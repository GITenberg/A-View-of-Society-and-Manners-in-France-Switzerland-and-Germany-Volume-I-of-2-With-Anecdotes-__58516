<h2>ADVERTISEMENT.</h2>

<p>From a diffidence of his own abilities,
and from other motives not so well
founded, the Author of the following Letters
thought it expedient, in the first edition,
to throw a slight veil over the real situation
in which they were written: he imagined
also, that by this means some reflections,
particularly those on gaming, might be introduced
more naturally, and with a stronger
effect. But having been assured by those of
whose friendship and judgment he is equally
convinced, that the assumed character
and feigned situation in the two first letters
gave an air of fiction to the real incidents
in the rest of the work, he has now restored
those two letters to their original form.</p>

<p class="noindent">MY LORD DUKE,</p>

<p>Although established practice
might, on this occasion, justify
my holding a language to your Grace
which I never before used, yet you
have nothing of that kind to fear;
it is as inconsistent with my disposition
to offer adulation, as it is contrary
to yours to desire it.—Nor does<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii" id="Page_ii">[ii]</a></span>
this address proceed from a vain belief
that the lustre of your name will
dispose the Public to wink at the blemishes
of my performance. The
highest titles do not screen even those
to whom they belong from contempt,
when their personal characters are
contemptible; far less can they shelter
the dulness or folly of others.</p>

<p>I am prompted to offer this View of
Society and Manners to your Grace, by
sentiments of the most sincere esteem
and attachment; and, exclusive of all
considerations of that nature, it is presented
with peculiar propriety to you,
as no other person has had equal opportunities
of knowing how far the
objects it comprehends are just, and
faithfully drawn from nature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii" id="Page_iii">[iii]</a></span></p>

<p>Some perhaps may imagine, that I
should have displayed more prudence
in offering this work to a less competent
judge; but I am encouraged
in my desire of prefixing your Name
to these imperfect sketches, by the
fond persuasion that nobody can be
more inclined to afford them the indulgence
of which I am sensible they
stand in so much need.</p>

<p>I have the honour to be, with the
most respectful and cordial regard,</p>

<p class="dropcap">I was greatly disappointed by your
not coming to town, as you intended,
having been for some time
impatient to inform you of what passed
between your young friend —— and me;
I relied till the moment of our departure
on having an opportunity of doing this
personally, and I seize the first occasion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
communicating the whole to you, in the
only manner now in my power.</p>

<p>You will remember the uneasiness you
once expressed to me on account of that
gentleman’s propensity to gaming, and of
the inconveniencies to which he had been
put by some recent losses; you will also remember
the resolutions which, in consequence
of your request, he formed against
play; but you have yet to learn, that he
resumed the dice before the month was
ended in which he had determined never
to touch them more, and concluded one
unfortunate night, by throwing away a
sum far exceeding any of his former
losses.</p>

<p>Ashamed of his weakness, he carefully
concealed his misfortune from you, and
thereby has been subjected to some distresses
of a more mortifying nature than any he
had formerly felt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>What shocked him most, was a circumstance
which will not greatly astonish you—the
indifference which many who call
themselves his friends, showed at his situation,
and the coldness with which they
excused themselves from making any attempts
to relieve him from his difficulties.
Several to whom he had advanced considerable
sums in the days of his good fortune,
declared a perfect inability of repaying
any part of their debt; they told some
sad tale of an unforeseen accident, which
had put that entirely out of their power
for the present; yet one of those unfortunate
gentlemen, the same evening that
he refused to repay our friend, lost double
the sum, every farthing of which he actually
paid in ready money.</p>

<p>Mr. ——’s expectations from those resources
having in a great measure failed,
he applied to Mr. P—— in the City, who
supplied him with money, at legal interest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
sufficient to clear all his debts, for which
he has granted him a mortgage on his
estate.—While our young friend informed
me of all this, he declared, that the remorse
he felt on the recollection of his
folly was infinitely greater than any pleasure
he had ever experienced from winning, or
could enjoy from the utmost success. He
expressed, at the same time, a strong sense
of obligation to you and to me, for our
endeavours to wean him from the habit of
gaming, regretted that they had not been
sooner successful, but was happy to find,
that he still had enough left to enable him
to live in a decent manner, agreeable to a
plan of œconomy which he has laid down,
and to which he is resolved to adhere till the
mortgage is relieved. “I have now (added
he in a solemn manner) formed an ultimate
resolution against gaming for the rest
of my life; if I ever deviate from this,
you have a right to consider me as devoid
of manly firmness and truth, unworthy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
of your friendship, and the weakest of
mortals.”</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the young gentleman’s
failure on a former occasion, yet the just
reflections he made on his past conduct, and
the determined manner in which he spoke,
give me great hopes that he will keep his
present resolution.—To him I seemed fully
persuaded of this, and ventured to say,
that I could scarcely regret his last run of
bad luck, which had operated so blessed an
effect; for he who has the vigour to disentangle
himself from the snares of deep play,
at the expence of half his fortune, and
with his character entire, may on the whole
be esteemed a fortunate man. I therefore
insisted strongly on the wisdom of his plan,
which I contrasted with the usual determination
of those who have been unlucky
at play. Without fortitude to retrench
their expences, or bear their first misfortunes,
they can only bring themselves the length
of resolving to renounce gaming <i>as soon as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
they shall regain what they have lost</i>; and
imagining they have still a claim to the
money which is now in the pockets of
others, because it was once in their own,
they throw away their whole fortune in
search of an inconsiderable part, and finish
by being completely ruined, because they
could not support a small inconvenience. I
pointed out, how infinitely more honourable
it was to depend for repairing his fortune
on his own good sense and perseverance,
than on the revolutions of chance;
which, even if they should be favourable,
could only re-establish him at the expence
of others, most probably of those who
had no hand in occasioning his losses. His
inseparable companion —— —— entered
while I was in the middle of my harangue.
Our friend, who had previously acquainted
him with his determination of renouncing
gaming, endeavoured to prevail on that
gentleman to adopt the same measure, but
in vain. —— —— laughed at his proposal,
said, “he was too easily terrified; that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
one tolerable run of good fortune would
retrieve his affairs; that my fears about
ruin were mere bugbears; that the word
<i>ruin</i>, like cannon charged with powder,
had an alarming sound, but was attended
with no danger; that if the worst should
happen, I could but be ruined; which
was only being in the same situation
with some of the most fashionable people
in the nation.”</p>

<p>He then enumerated many instances of
those who lived as well as the wealthiest
men in England, and yet every body pronounced
them ruined. “There is Ch——
F——, added he, a man completely
ruined; yet beloved by his friends, and
admired by his country as much as
ever.”</p>

<p>To this fine reasoning I replied, “That
if nobody had been influenced by that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
gentleman’s example, except those who
possessed his genius, his turn for play
would never have hurt one man in the
kingdom; but that those who owed their
importance solely to their fortune, ought
not to risk it so wantonly as he might
do, whose fortune had always been of
little importance, when compared with
his abilities; and since they could not
imitate Mr. F—— in the things for
which he was so justly applauded, they
ought not to follow his example in those
for which he was as justly condemned;
for the same fire which burns a piece of
wood to ashes, can only melt a guinea,
which still retains its intrinsic value,
<i>though his Majesty’s countenance no longer
shines upon it</i>.”</p>

<p>—— —— did not seem to relish my argument,
and soon after left us; but our
young friend seemed confirmed in his resolutions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
and gave me fresh assurances, the
day on which I left London, that he never
would vary.</p>

<p>Knowing the interest you take in his
welfare, and the high esteem he has for
you, I have thought it right to give you
this piece of information which I know will
afford you pleasure. His greatest difficulty
in adhering to the new adopted plan
will be at first; in his present state of mind,
the soothings and support of friendship
may be of the greatest service.</p>

<p>When your affairs permit you to go to
London, I dare say you will take the earliest
opportunity of throwing yourself in his
way: You will find no difficulty in persuading
him to accompany you to the country.
Removed for some months from his present
companions and usual lounging-places,
the influence of his old habits will gradually
diminish; and, confirmed by your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
conversation, small chance will remain of
his being sucked into the old system, and
again whirled round in the vortex of dissipation
and gaming.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="LETTER_II">LETTER II.</h2>

<p class="right">Paris.</p>

<p>Your setting out for London immediately
on the receipt of my letter,
is what might have been expected.—Nothing
renders a man so active as an eager
desire of doing good; and I might have
foreseen, that you would catch at the opportunity
with which I furnished you to
indulge a ruling passion.</p>

<p>It gives me great satisfaction to know,
that our young friend and you are upon
such a confidential footing; and I heartily
hope that nothing will interrupt a connection
which must be a source of pleasing reflection
to you, and in every way advantageous
to him.—I had no doubt that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
would readily agree to accompany you to the
country; but I was not so certain that he
might not have found it necessary to accept
of your other very friendly proposal.—His
refusal is a proof, that he has reconciled his
mind to his circumstances; and, with those
sentiments, I am convinced that he will be
able to live within his remaining yearly income
with more satisfaction than he
enjoyed when he spent five times that
sum.—</p>

<p>You insist so much on my writing to
you regularly, from the different places
where I may reside during my absence from
England, that I begin to believe you are in
earnest, and shall certainly obey your commands.</p>

<p>I know you do not expect from me a
minute account of churches and palaces.
However agreeable these may be to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
spectator, they generally afford but a slender
entertainment when served up in description.</p>

<p>There are countries, some of which I
may again visit before my return to England,
whose appearance always strikes the
eye with delight; but it is difficult to
convey a precise idea of their beauties
in words. The pencil is a more powerful
vehicle than the pen for that purpose;
for the landscape is apt to vanish from
the mind before the description can be
read.</p>

<p>The manners, customs, and characters
of the people may probably furnish the
chief materials in the correspondence
you exact, with such reflections as may
arise from the subject. In these, I apprise
you before-hand, I shall take what
latitude I please: And though the complexion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
of my letters may most probably
receive some tint or shade of colouring
from the country where they may be
wrote; yet if I take it into my head to
insist on the little tricks of an attorney,
when you expect to hear of the politics
of a prime minister; or, if I tell you a
tale about an old woman, when you are
impatient for anecdotes of a great general,
you must not fret or fall into a passion;
for if you do not permit me to write
on what subjects I please, and treat them
in my own way, the correspondence
you require would become a sad slavery to
me, and of consequence no amusement to
you. Whereas, if you leave me free
and unrestrained, it will at least form
some occupation to myself, may wean
me from the habit of lounging, and will
afford an excuse, in my own mind, for
my leaving those parties of pleasure
where people are apt to continue, forcing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
smiles, and yawning spontaneously
for two or three hours after all relish is
fled.</p>

<p>Yet in this dismal condition many remain
night after night, because the hour of
sleep is not yet arrived;—and what else can
they do?</p>

<p>Have you never found yourself in this
listless situation? Without any pleasure
where you are, without any motive to be
gone, you remain in a kind of passive,
gaping oyster-state, till the tide of the
company moves you to your carriage.
And when you recover your reflection in
your bed-chamber, you find you have
passed the two last hours in a kind of humming
buzzing stupor, without satisfaction,
or ideas of any kind.</p>

<p>I thank you for your offer of Dupont.
Knowing your regard for him, and his
dexterity and intelligence in the science<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
of valet-de-chambreship, I see the full
force of the sacrifice you are willing to
make. If I could be so selfish on another
occasion as to accept your offer, the
good-will I bear to your old friend John
would prevent me at present. Dupont,
to be sure, is worth twenty of John for
that employment; but I can never forget
his long attachment, and I am now so
habituated to him, that one generally
esteemed a more perfect servant would
not suit me so well. I think myself
benefited even by his deficiencies, which
have obliged me to do many things for
myself that other people perform by the
hands of their servants. Many of our acquaintances
seem absolutely incapable of
motion, till they have been wound up by
their valets. They have no more use of
their hands for any office about their own
persons, than if they were paralytic. At
night they must wait for their servants, before
they can undress themselves, and go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
to bed: In the morning, if the valet happen
to be out of the way, the master must
remain helpless and sprawling in bed, like
a turtle on its back upon the kitchen-table
of an alderman.</p>

<h2 id="LETTER_III">LETTER III.</h2>

<p class="right">Paris.</p>

<p>I Went a few nights since to the Italian
Comedy; while I enjoyed the exquisite
<i>naiveté</i> of my old friend Carlin, the Marquis
de F——, whom you have seen at
London, entered the box:—He flew to me
with all the vivacity of a Frenchman, and
with every mark of pleasure and regard.
He had ten thousand questions to ask
about his friends in England all in one
breath, and without waiting for an answer.
Mon cher ami this, ma chere amie t’other;
la belle such a one, la charmante such
another.</p>

<p>Perceiving we disturbed the company,
and having no hopes that the Marquis
would be more quiet for some time, I proposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
leaving the Comedy. He assented
immediately:—Vous avez raison: il n’y
a personne ici; c’est un désert—(by the
way, the house was very much crowded)—Je
suis venu comme vous voyez en polisson;—tout
le monde est au Colisée—Allons.—We
stepped into his vis-à-vis:
He ordered the coachman to drive vîte
comme tous les diables. The horses went
as fast as they could, and the Marquis’s
tongue still faster than they.</p>

<p>When we arrived, I proposed going up
to the gallery, where we might see the
company below, and converse without interruption,
Bon, says he, nous nous
nicherons dans un coin pour critiquer
tout le monde, comme deux diables boiteux.</p>

<p>A lady of a fine shape and majestic air
drew my attention: I asked the Marquis
if he did not think her remarkably handsome?—Là,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
là, said he, coldly.—Nous
sommes heureusement placés pour elle.
C’est un tableau fait pour être vu de loin.—I
then took notice of the excessive whiteness
of her skin.—C’est apparemment le
goût de son amant d’aujourd’hui, said he;
et quand un autre se présenteroit qui préféreroit
la couleur de puce, à l’aide d’un peu
d’eau chaude, elle seroit aussi son affaire.</p>

<p>I next remarked two ladies dressed a
little beyond the extravagance of the
mode. Their features betrayed the approach
of fifty, in spite of all the art which
had evidently been used to conceal that
hated age.</p>

<p>At sight of them the Marquis started up.
Ah! parblieu, said he, ces deux morceaux
d’antiquité sont de mes parentes.—Excusez
moi pour deux minutes: il faut
que je m’approche d’elles, pour les féliciter
de leurs appas. Old ladies, continued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
he, who have the rage to be thought
young, are of all animals the most vindictive
when neglected, and I have particular
reasons for wishing to remain in
their good graces. He then left me, and
having walked round the circle with the
ladies, returned and took his seat. I have
got myself well out of the scrape, said he;
I told them I was engaged with a Milord,
whom I should have the honour of presenting
at their house; and I fixed a young
officer with them, whose best hopes of promotion
depend upon their influence at
court, and who dares as soon quit his colours
in battle, as forsake these two pieces
of old tapestry till they chuse to retire.</p>

<p>A young man very magnificently dressed
entered the room: He announced his importance
by his airs, his bustle, the loud
and decisive tone of his voice. The Marquis
told me, it was Mons. le Duc de ——;
that it was indispensably necessary that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
should be presented to him; there was no
living at Paris without that advantage; adding,—Il
est un peu fat, infiniment bête;
d’ailleurs le meilleur enfant du monde.</p>

<p>A fine lady next appeared who seemed
to command the admiration of the whole
assembly. She floated round the circle of
the Colisée, surrounded by a cluster of
Petits Maitres, whose eyes were fixed on
her, and who seemed moved by her motion,
like satellites under the influence of their
planet. She, on her part, was perfectly
serene, and unembarrassed by the attention
and the eyes of the spectators. She smiled
to one, nodded to another, shrugged to a
third, struck a fourth with her fan, burst
into a fit of laughter to a fifth, and whispered
in the ear of a sixth. All these, and a
thousand tricks more, she ran through with
the ease of an actress and the rapidity of a
juggler. She seemed fully persuaded that
she was the only person present worthy of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
attention; that it belonged to her to develop
her charms, display her graces and
airs, and that it was the part of the rest of
the company to remain attentive and admiring
spectators.</p>

<p>Cette drolesse là, said the Marquis,
est jolie, et pour cette raison on croit
qu’elle a de l’esprit: On a même tâché de
répéter ses bons mots; mais ils ne sont faits
que pour sa bouche. Elle est beaucoup
plus vaine que sensible, grand soutien pour
sa vertu! au reste, elle est dame de qualité,
à la faveur de quoi elle possede un goût
de hardiesse si heureux, qu’elle jouit du
bénéfice de l’effronterie sans être effrontée.</p>

<p>I was surprised to find all this satire directed
against so beautiful a woman, and
suspected that the edge of F——’s remarks
was sharpened by some recent pique.
I was going to rally him on that supposition,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
when he suddenly started up, saying, Voilà
Mons. de ——, le meilleur de mes amis.—Il
est aimable; on ne peut pas plus.—Il a
de l’esprit comme un démon.—Il faut que
vous le connoissiez. Allons:—Descendons.
So saying, he hurried me down stairs, presented
me to Mons. de —— as un philosophe
Anglois, who understood race-horses better
than the great Newton himself, and who
had no aversion to the game of Whist.
Mons. de —— received me with open arms,
and we were intimate friends in ten minutes.
He carried the Marquis and me to
sup at his house, where he found a numerous
company.</p>

<p>The conversation was cheerful and animated.
There were some very ingenious
men present, with an admirable mixture of
agreeable women, who remained to the
last, and joined in the conversation even
when it turned on subjects of literature;
upon which occasions English ladies generally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
imagine it becomes them to remain
silent. But here they took their share
without scruple or hesitation. Those who
understood any thing of the subject delivered
their sentiments with great precision,
and more grace than the men; those who
knew nothing of the matter rallied their
own ignorance in such a sprightly manner,
as convinced every body, that knowledge
is not necessary to render a woman exceedingly
agreeable in society.</p>

<p>After passing a most delightful evening,
I returned to my lodgings, my head undisturbed
with wine, and my spirits unjaded
by play.</p>

<p>We have been a month at Paris; a
longer time than was intended at

me at a greater distance now than it did
then.</p>

<p>F—— has been my most constant companion;
he is universally liked, lives in
the very best company, and whoever is introduced
by him is sure of a favourable reception.
I found little or no difficulty in excusing
myself from play. The Marquis
undertook to make this matter easy; and
nothing can be a greater proof of his influence
in some of the most fashionable
circles, than his being able to introduce a
man without a title, and who never
games.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>He is also intimately acquainted with
some of the most eminent men of letters, to
whom he has made me known. Many
of those, whose works you admire, are received
at the houses of the first nobility on
the most liberal footing.</p>

<p>You can scarcely believe the influence
which this body of men have in the gay
and dissipated city of Paris. Their opinions
not only determine the merit of works of
taste and science, but they have considerable
weight on the manners and sentiments
of people of rank, of the public in general,
and consequently are not without effect on
the measures of government.</p>

<p>The same thing takes place in some degree
in most countries of Europe; but, if
I am not mistaken, more at Paris than any
where else; because men of letters are here
at once united to each other by the various<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
academies, and diffused among private societies,
by the manners and general taste of
the nation.</p>

<p>As the sentiments and conversation of
men of letters influence, to a certain degree,
the opinions and the conduct of the
fashionable world; the manners of these
last have a more obvious effect upon the
air, the behaviour, and the conversation of
the former, which in general is polite and
easy; equally purified from the awkward
timidity contracted in retirement, and the
disgusting arrogance inspired by university
honours, or church dignities. At Paris,
the pedants of Moliere are to be seen on
the stage only.</p>

<p>In this country, at present, there are
many men distinguished by their learning,
who at the same time are cheerful and easy
in mixed company, unpresuming in argument,
and in every respect as well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
bred as those who have no other pretension.</p>

<p>Politeness and good manners, indeed,
may be traced, though in different proportions,
through every rank, from the greatest
of the nobility to the lowest mechanic.
This forms a more remarkable and distinguishing
feature in the French national
character, than the vivacity, impetuosity,
and fickleness, for which the ancient as well
as the modern inhabitants of this country
have been noted.—It certainly is a very
singular phænomenon, that politeness, which
in every other country is confined to people
of a certain rank in life, should here pervade
every situation and profession. The
man in power is courteous to his dependant,
the prosperous to the unfortunate, the
very beggar who solicits charity, does it
‘en homme comme il faut;’ and if his
request be not granted, he is sure, at least,
that it will be refused with an appearance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
of humanity, and not with harshness or
insult.</p>

<p>A stranger, quite new and unversed in
their language, whose accent is uncouth
and ridiculous in the ears of the French,
and who can scarcely open his mouth
without making a blunder in grammar or
idiom, is heard with the most serious attention,
and never laughed at, even when
he utters the oddest solecism or equivocal
expression.</p>

<p>I am afraid, said I, yesterday, to a French
gentleman, the phrase which I used just
now is not French. Monsieur, replied he,
cette expression effectivement n’est pas
Françoise, mais elle mérite bien de l’être.</p>

<p>The most daring deviation from fashion,
in the important article of dress, cannot
make them forget the laws of good-breeding.
When a person appears at the public<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
walks, in clothes made against every law
of the mode, upon which the French are
supposed to lay such stress, they do not
gaze or sneer at him; they allow him first
to pass, as it were, unobserved, and do not
till then turn round to indulge the curiosity
which his uncommon figure may have
excited. I have remarked this instance of
delicacy often in the streets in the lowest
of the vulgar, or rather of the common
people; for there are really very few of
the natives of Paris, who can be called
vulgar.</p>

<p>There are exceptions to these, as to all
general remarks on the manners and character
of any nation.</p>

<p>I have heard instances of the military
treating postillions and inn-keepers with
injustice; and the seigneur or intendant
oppressing the peasant. Examples of the
abuse of power, and insolence of office,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
are to be met with every where. If they
are tolerated, the fault lies in the government.</p>

<p>I have not been speaking of the French
government. Their national character is
one thing; the nature of their government
is a very different matter. But I am convinced
there is no country in Europe where
royal favour, high birth, and the military
profession, could be allowed such privileges
as they have in France, and where there
would be so few instances of their producing
rough and brutal behaviour to
inferiors.</p>

<h2 id="LETTER_V">LETTER V.</h2>

<p class="right">Paris.</p>

<p>A candid Englishman, of whatever rank
in life he may be, must see with indignation,
that every thing in this kingdom
is arranged for the accommodation of the
rich and the powerful; and that little or
no regard is paid to the comfort of citizens
of an inferior station. This appears in a
thousand instances, and strikes the eye immediately
on entering Paris.</p>

<p>I think I have seen it somewhere remarked,
that the regular and effectual manner
in which the city of London is lighted at
night, and the raised pavements on the sides
of every street, for the security and conveniency
of foot passengers, seem to indicate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
that the body of the people, as well as
the rich and great, are counted of some
importance in the eye of government.
Whereas Paris is poorly and partially lighted;
and except on the Pont Neuf and Pont
Royal, and the keys between them, is not
provided with foot-ways for the accommodation
and safety of those who cannot
afford carriages. They must therefore
grope their way as they best can, and
skulk behind pillars, or run into shops,
to avoid being crushed by the coaches,
which are driven as near the wall as the
coachman pleases; dispersing the people
on foot at their approach, like chaff before
the wind.</p>

<p>It must be acknowledged, that monarchy
(for the French do not love to hear it called
despotism, and it is needless to quarrel with
them about a word) is raised in this country
so very high, that it quite loses sight of
the bulk of the nation, and pays attention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
only to a few; who, being in exalted stations,
come within the Court’s sphere of vision.</p>

<p>Le peuple, in France, is a term of reproach.—Un
homme du peuple, implies
a want of both education and manners.
Un homme comme il faut, on the other
hand, does not imply a man of sense or
principle, but simply a man of birth or
fashion; for a man may be homme comme
il faut, and yet be devoid of every quality
which adorns human nature. There
is no question that government leaves the
middle and inferior ranks of life in some
degree unprotected, and exposed to the injustice
and insolence of the great; who are
considered in this country, as somewhat
above the Law, though greatly below the
Monarch.</p>

<p>But the polished mildness of French
manners, the gay and sociable turn of the
nation, the affable and easy conduct of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
masters to their servants, supply the deficiencies,
and correct the errors, of the
government, and render the condition of
the common people in France, but particularly
at Paris, better than in several
other countries of Europe; and much more
tolerable than it would be, if the national
character resembled that of those countries.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I was interrupted by Lord M. who arrived
last night. He agreed to dine with
us. F—— called soon after: he was
disengaged also, and promised to be of the
party.</p>

<p>You know how laborious a thing it is to
keep alive a dialogue with my Lord M.
The conversation either degenerates into a
soliloquy on your part, or expires altogether.
I was therefore exceedingly happy
with the thoughts of the Marquis’s company.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
He was uncommonly lively; addressed
much of his conversation to his
Lordship; tried him upon every subject,
wine, women, horses, politics, and religion.
He then sung Chansons à boire,
and endeavoured in vain to get my Lord to
join in the chorus. Nothing would do.—He
admired his clothes, praised his dog,
and said a thousand obliging things of the
English nation. To no purpose; his Lordship
kept up his silence and reserve to the
last, and then drove away to the opera.</p>

<p>Ma foi, said the Marquis, as soon as
he went out of the room, il a de grands
talens pour le silence, ce Milord là.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2 id="LETTER_VI">LETTER VI.</h2>

<p class="right">Paris.</p>

<p>In a former letter, I mentioned good
breeding as a striking part of the French
national character. Loyalty, or an uncommon
fondness for, and attachment to,
the persons of their princes, is another.</p>

<p>An Englishman, though he views the
virtues of his king with a jealous eye during
his reign, yet he will do them all justice
in the reign of his successor.</p>

<p>A German, while he is silent with respect
to the foibles of his prince, admires
all his talents much more than he would
the same qualities in any other person.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>A Turk, or Persian, contemplates his
Emperor with fear and reverence, as a superior
being, to whose pleasure it is his duty
to submit, as to the laws of Nature, and
the will of Providence.</p>

<p>But a Frenchman, while he knows that
his king is of the same nature, and liable
to all the weaknesses of other men; while
he enumerates his follies, and laughs as he
laments them, is nevertheless attached to
him by a sentiment of equal respect and
tenderness; a kind of affectionate prejudice,
independent of his real character.</p>

<p><i>Roi</i><a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> is a word which conveys to the
minds of Frenchmen the ideas of benevolence,
gratitude, and love; as well as
those of power, grandeur, and happiness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>They flock to Versailles every Sunday,
behold him with unsated curiosity, and
gaze on him with as much satisfaction the
twentieth time as the first.</p>

<p>They consider him as their friend, though
he does not know their persons; as their
protector, though their greatest danger is
from an Exempt or Lettre de Cachet; and
as their benefactor, while they are oppressed
with taxes.</p>

<p>They magnify into importance his most
indifferent actions; they palliate and excuse
all his weaknesses; and they impute his
errors or crimes, to his ministers or other
evil counsellors; who (as they fondly assert)
have, for some base purpose, imposed upon
his judgment, and perverted the undeviating
rectitude of his intentions.</p>

<p>They repeat, with fond applause, every
saying of his which seems to indicate the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
smallest approach to wit, or even bears the
mark of ordinary sagacity.</p>

<p>The most inconsiderable circumstance
which relates to the Monarch is of importance:
whether he eat much or little at dinner;
the coat he wears, the horse on which
he rides, all afford matter of conversation
in the various societies at Paris, and are the
most agreeable subjects of epistolary correspondence
with their friends in the provinces.</p>

<p>If he happens to be a little indisposed,
all Paris, all France, is alarmed, as if a
real calamity was threatened: and to seem
interested, or to converse upon any other
subject till this has been discussed, would
be considered as a proof of unpardonable
indifference.</p>

<p>At a review, the troops perform their
manœuvres unheeded by such of the spectators
as are within sight of the King.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
They are all engrossed in contemplation of
their Prince.—Avez vous vu le roi?—Tenez—ah!—voilà
le roi.—Le roi rit.—Apparemment
il est content.—Je suis charmé,—ah,
il tousse!—A-t-il toussé?—Oui,
parbleu! et bien fort.—Je suis au
désespoir.</p>

<p>At mass, it is the King, not the Priest,
who is the object of attention. The Host
is elevated; but the people’s eyes remain
fixed upon the face of their beloved Monarch.</p>

<p>Even the most applauded pieces of the
theatre, which in Paris create more emotion
than the ceremonies of religion, can
with difficulty divide their attention. A
smile from the King makes them forget the
sorrow of Andromaché, and the wrongs of
the Cid.</p>

<p>This excessive attachment is not confined
to the person of the Monarch, but extends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
to every branch of the royal family; all of
whom, it is imagined in this country, have
an hereditary right to every gratification and
enjoyment that human nature is capable
of receiving. And if any cause, moral or
physical, impede or obstruct this, they meet
with universal sympathy. The most trivial
disappointment or chagrin which befals
them, is considered as more serious and
affecting, than the most dreadful calamity,
which can happen to a private family. It
is lamented as if the natural order of things
were counteracted, and the amiable Prince,
or Princess, deprived, by a cruel phænomenon,
of that supreme degree of happiness,
to which their rank in life gives
them an undeniable title.</p>

<p>All this regard seems real, and not affected
from any motive of interest; at least
it must be so with respect to the bulk of
the people, who can have no hopes of ever
being known to their princes, far less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
of ever receiving any personal favour from
them.</p>

<p>The philosophical idea, that Kings have
been appointed for public conveniency;
that they are accountable to their subjects
for mal-administration, or for continued
acts of injustice and oppression; is a doctrine
very opposite to the general prejudices
of this nation. If any of their kings were
to behave in such an imprudent and outrageous
manner as to occasion a revolt, and
if the insurgents actually got the better, I
question if they would think of new-modelling
the government, and limiting the
power of the crown, as was done in Britain
at the Revolution, so as to prevent the like
abuses for the future. They never would
think of going further, I imagine, than
placing another prince of the Bourbon
family on the throne, with the same power
that his predecessor had, and then quietly
lay down their arms, satisfied with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
royal word or declaration to govern with
more equity.</p>

<p>The French seem so delighted and
dazzled with the lustre of Monarchy, that
they cannot bear the thoughts of any qualifying
mixture, which might abate its violence,
and render its ardour more benign.
They chuse to give the splendid machine
full play, though it often scorches and
threatens to consume themselves and their
effects.</p>

<p>They consider the power of the king,
from which their servitude proceeds, as
if it were their own power. You will
hardly believe it; but I am sure of the
fact: They are proud of it; they are proud
that there is no check or limitation to his
authority.</p>

<p>They tell you with exultation, that the
king has an army of near two hundred
thousand men in the time of peace. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
Frenchman is as vain of the palaces, fine
gardens, number of horses, and all the paraphernalia
belonging to the court of the
Monarch, as an Englishman can be of his
own house, gardens, and equipage.</p>

<p>When they are told of the diffusion of
wealth in England, the immense fortunes
made by many individuals, the affluence of
those of middle rank, the security and easy
situation of the common people; instead
of being mortified by the comparison
which might naturally occur to their imaginations,
they comfort themselves with
the reflection, that the court of France is
more brilliant than the court of Great
Britain, and that the duke of Orleans and
the Prince of Condé have greater revenues
than any of the English nobility.</p>

<p>When they hear of the freedom of debate
in parliament, of the liberties taken
in writing or speaking of the conduct of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
the king, or measures of government, and
the forms to be observed, before those who
venture on the most daring abuse of either
can be brought to punishment, they seem
filled with indignation, and say with an air
of triumph, C’est bien autrement chez
nous: Si le Roi de France avoit affaire à ces
Messieurs là, il leur apprendroit à vivre.
And then they would proceed to inform
you, that, parbleu! their minister would
give himself no trouble about forms or
proofs; that suspicion was sufficient for him,
and without more ado he would shut up
such impertinent people in the Bastille for
many years. And then raising their voices,
as if what they said were a proof of the
courage or magnanimity of the minister—Ou
peut-être il feroit condamner ces drôles
là aux galères pour la vie.</p>

<p class="right">Paris.</p>

<p>It would be almost superfluous to observe,
that there are a great many people in
France, who think in a very different manner
from that which I have mentioned in
my last, and who have just and liberal ideas
of the design and nature of government,
and proper and manly sentiments of the natural
rights of mankind. The writings of
Montesquieu are greatly admired: This
alone is sufficient to prove it. Many later
authors, and the conversation of the philosophical
and reasoning people, display the
same spirit.</p>

<p>What is mentioned in my last letter,
however, comprehends the general turn
or manner of thinking of the French nation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
and evinces how very opposite their
sentiments upon the subject of civil government
are, to those of our countrymen.</p>

<p>I have heard an Englishman enumerate
the advantages of the British constitution
to a circle of French Bourgeois, and explain
to them in what manner the people of
their rank of life were protected from the
insolence of the courtiers and nobility; that
the poorest shop-keeper and lowest tradesman
in England, could have immediate
redress for any injury done him by the
greatest nobleman in the kingdom.</p>

<p>Well, what impression do you think this
declamation had upon the French auditory?
You will naturally imagine they would admire
such a constitution, and wish for the
same in France:—Not at all. They sympathized
with the great: They seemed to
feel for their want of importance. One
observed, C’est peu de chose d’être noble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
chez vous; and another, shaking his head,
added, Ce n’est pas naturel tout cela.</p>

<p>When mention was made that the king
of Great Britain could not impose a tax by
his own authority; that the consent of parliament,
particularly of the house of commons,
was necessary, to which assembly
people of their rank of life were admitted;
they said with some degree of satisfaction,
Cependant, c’est assez beau cela. But
when the English patriot, expecting their
complete approbation, continued informing
them, that the king himself had not the
power to encroach upon the liberty of the
meanest of his subjects; that if he or the
minister did, damages were recoverable at
a court of law, a loud and prolonged
<span class="smcapuc">DIABLE</span> issued from every mouth. They
forgot their own situation, and the security
of the people, and turned to their natural
bias of sympathy with the King, who they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
all seemed to think must be the most oppressed
and injured of mankind.</p>

<p>One of them at last, addressing himself
to the English politician, said, Tout ce
que je puis vous dire, Monsieur, c’est que
votre pauvre Roi est bien à plaindre.</p>

<p>This solicitude of theirs for the happiness
and glory of royalty extends in some
degree to all crowned heads whatever: But
with regard to their own monarch, it seems
the reigning and darling passion of their
souls, which they carry with them to the
grave.</p>

<p>A French soldier, who lay covered with
wounds on the field of Dettingen, demanded,
a little before he expired, of an English
officer, how the battle was likely to terminate;
and being answered, that the British
troops had obtained a great victory; Mon
pauvre Roi, said the dying man, que fera-t-il?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>For my part, my friend, although I
heartily wish his Majesty all public and domestic
happiness, yet if the smallest solicitude
about either should disturb my dying
moments, it will be the strongest proof
that my own affairs, spiritual and temporal,
your concerns, as well as those of my other
private friends, are in a most comfortable
situation.</p>

<p class="right">Adieu.</p>

<p><i>P. S.</i> I have not seen the Marquis for
several days. He had informed me, at
our very first meeting, that he was paying
his court to a young lady of family, at his
mother’s desire, who was impatient to see
him married. He said, he could refuse
his mother nothing, parcequ’elle étoit le
meilleur enfant du monde: Besides, he
said, the young lady was very pretty and
agreeable, and he was over head and ears
in love with her. He has told me since,
that every thing was arranged, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
expected to be in a short time the happiest
man in the world, and would have the
honour of presenting me to his bride very
soon. I shall let you know my opinion of
the lady when I see her—But let her be
what she will, I am sorry that F——
thinks of marrying so early in life; for a
Frenchman of five and twenty, is not quite
so sedate an animal as an Englishman of
fifteen.</p>

<h2 id="LETTER_VIII">LETTER VIII.</h2>

<p class="right">Paris.</p>

<p>There is an absolute penury of public
news. I have nothing particular
to inform you of concerning myself; but
you hold me to my engagement: So here
I am seated to write to you, without having
as yet determined upon a subject, in
hopes, however, that my pen may gather
materials as it moves.</p>

<p>In whatever light this prejudice in favour
of monarchy may appear to the eye
of philosophy; and though of all passions
the love of a King, merely because he is a
King, is perhaps the silliest; yet it surely
ought to be considered as meritorious by
those who are the objects of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>No people existing, or who did ever exist,
have had so just a claim to the gratitude
and affections of their sovereign, as the
French. They rejoice in his joy, are grieved
at his grief, proud of his power, vain of his
accomplishments, indulgent to his failings.
They cheerfully yield their own conveniences
to his superfluities, and are at all
times willing to sacrifice their lives for his
glory.</p>

<p>A King, one would imagine, must be a
perfect monster of selfishness and insensibility,
who did not love such subjects, and
who did not bestow some time and attention
to promote their happiness: Yet the
French nation has not had a Monarch worthy
of all this regard since the days of
Henry IV. and of all their kings they used
him the worst.</p>

<p>Of the three brothers who immediately
preceded him, the first was a sickly creature,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
as feeble in mind as in body; the second,
a monster of superstition and cruelty;
and the third, after a dawn of some brightness,
allowed his meridian to be obscured
by the grossest clouds of effeminacy and
voluptuousness. Their Italian mother, who
governed all the three, seems to have been
perfectly unrestrained by any feelings of
humanity or of conscience, and solely
guided by motives of interest, and the most
perfidious policy.</p>

<p>The princes who have succeeded, as well
as those who reigned before the fourth
Henry, serve as foils which display his
bright qualities with double lustre.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all the inducements
which the French Kings have to promote
the happiness of their subjects, it may be
many centuries before they are blessed with
one who shall have that passion in such a
high degree.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>A character in which the great and amiable
virtues are so finely blended, is very
rarely produced in any nation. How small
then must be the chance that this prize
shall fall to the individual who is destined
for the throne? Henry received an
education very different from that which is
generally bestowed on Kings. His character
was formed in the hardy school of
adversity: his mind was strengthened by
continual exertions of courage and prudence.
He was taught humanity by suffering
under the rod of tyranny, and experiencing
the pangs of the unfortunate.
Having frequently stood in need of friends,
he knew the value of their attachment, and
his heart became capable of friendship.</p>

<p>Difficulties and dangers often strike out
particles of genius which otherwise might
remain latent and useless, and contribute to
the formation of a vigorous character, by
animating those sparks of virtue which a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
life of indolence would have completely extinguished.</p>

<p>Those people who, from their earliest infancy,
have found every thing provided for
them, who have not much ambition, and
consequently are seldom excited to any
great exertion of their faculties, generally
feel these faculties dwindle and grow weak,
for the same reason that a man’s arms
would become gradually feeble, and at
length perfectly useless, if he were to
wear them in a scarf for any considerable
time.</p>

<p>That the faculties of the understanding,
like the sinews of the body, are relaxed
by sloth and strengthened by exercise, nobody
will doubt. I imagine the same analogy
holds in some degree between the
body and the qualities of the heart. Benevolence,
pity, gratitude, are, I suspect, exceedingly
apt to stagnate into a calm, sluggish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
insensibility in that breast which has
not been agitated by real misfortunes.</p>

<p>People do not fully enter into distresses
which they never have felt, and which
they think they run but a small risk of
feeling. Accordingly it has been remarked,
that those who have been favoured through
life with the smiles of fortune, and whose
time has been spent in the amusements of
courts, and luxurious indulgences, very often
acquire an astonishing insensibility to the
misfortunes of others. The character the
most perfectly cold of all I ever knew, devoid
of friendship, gratitude, and even natural
affection, belongs to a person, whose
life has been a continued series of fortunate
events.</p>

<p>Yet while all their cares are contracted,
and all their feelings absorbed, within the
compass of their own skin, such people
seem often convinced, that they themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
are of the most humane dispositions, and
the most extensive benevolence, upon no
better foundation, than because they have
felt themselves affected by the artful distresses
of a romance, and because they could
shed a few barren tears at a tragedy.</p>

<p>If to these symptoms of sensibility, they
can add, that of having occasionally given
a guinea when the contribution has been
set a going, or have parted with a little superfluous
money to free themselves from
importunity, they have then carried benevolence
to the utmost length of <i>their</i> idea
of that virtue.</p>

<p>They have no notion of any thing beyond
this; nor would they make one active
exertion, postpone a single party of
pleasure, or in any shape interrupt the
tranquillity of their own indolence, to perform
the most essential service (I will not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
say to a friend, such people can have none)
to any of the human race.</p>

<p>There are many exceptions, but in general
those persons who are exposed to <i>the
slings and arrows of outrageous fortune</i>,
who have experienced the base indifference
of mankind, and have in some degree <i>felt
what wretches feel</i>, are endued with the
truest sympathy, and enter, with the most
lively sensibility, into the situation of the
unfortunate.</p>

<p>I mentioned in a former letter, that my
friend F—— was on the point of
being married. He called at my lodgings
a little while ago. His air was so very gay,
that I imagined he had some agreeable
news to communicate. Me voilà au
désespoir, mon cher ami, said he, with a
loud laugh.—You are the merriest man I
ever saw in that situation, said I.—He then
informed me, that the old Marquis de P.
his mistress’s father, had waited on his mother,
and, after ten thousand apologies and
circumlocutions, had given her to understand,
that certain things had intervened,
which rendered it impossible that he should
ever have the honour of being father-in-law
to her son; and requested her to inform<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
him, how infinitely uneasy he and all
his family were, at an incident which deprived
them of the pleasure they had proposed
to themselves from that connection.
His mother, he said, had endeavoured to
discover the incident which has produced
this sudden alteration;—but to no purpose.—The
old gentleman contented himself
with assuring her, that the particulars
would be equally disagreeable and superfluous,—and
then took his leave, in the
most polite and affectionate terms that the
French language could furnish him with.</p>

<p>F—— told me all this with an air
so easy and contented, that I did not well
know what to make of it. My dear Marquis,
said I, it is fortunate that I have been
mistaken; for you must know, I had taken
it into my head that you were fond of the
lady.—You were in the right, my friend,
said he, je l’aimois infiniment.—Comment
infiniment; said I, and yet be so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
merry when you are just going to lose
her!—Mais vous autres Anglois, said he,
vous avez des idées si bizarres!—aimer
infiniment, cela veut dire aimer comme
on aime,—tout le monde s’aime ainsi quand
il ne se hait pas,—Mais je vous conterai
toute l’histoire.</p>

<p>My mother, added he, who is the best
creature in the world, and whom I love
with all my soul, told me this marriage
would make her quite happy.—All my
uncles and aunts, and cousins, for ten generations,
told me the same. I was informed,
over and above, that the lady,
her father, and all their relations, wished
this alliance, with the most obliging earnestness.
The girl, herself, is tolerably
pretty. They will persuade me to marry
some time or other, thought I; why not
now, as well as at another time? Why
should I refuse to do a thing which will
please so many people, without being in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
the smallest degree displeasing to myself?—To
be sure, said I, that would have been
ill-natured. It was lucky, however, that
you happened to be perfectly disengaged,
and did not prefer any other woman.</p>

<p>You are mistaken, my friend, said he;
I preferred many to the lady in question,
and one in particular, whose name I will
not mention, but whom I love—whom I
do love.—Comme on aime, said I, interrupting
him.—Non, parbleu! added
he, with warmth, comme on n’aime
pas.—Good Heaven! then, cried I, how
could you think of marrying another?—Celà
n’empêche rien, said the Marquis,
coolly;—for I could not marry the other.
She had the start of me, and had undergone
the ceremony already; and therefore
she had no objection to my obliging my
mother and relations in this particular, for
she is the best-natured woman in the
world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>So she appears to be, said I.—O,
pour cela oui, mon cher, added he, elle est
la bonté même. However, I am very well
pleased, upon the whole, that the affair
has gone off without any fault of mine;
and though it is possible that it may be
brought on at some future period, I shall
still be a gainer, parceque un mariage
reculé est toujours autant de gagné sur le
repentir. So saying, he wheeled on his
heel, humming,</p>

<h2 id="LETTER_X">LETTER X.</h2>

<p class="right">Paris.</p>

<p>You have often heard the French accused
of insincerity, and of being
warm in professions, but devoid of real
friendship.</p>

<p>Our countrymen, in particular, are led
into this opinion, from the manners in general
being more obsequious here, than in
England. What Frenchmen consider as
common good manners, many Englishmen
would call flattery, perhaps fawning.</p>

<p>Their language abounds in complimental
phrases, which they distribute with wonderful
profusion and volubility; but they
intend no more by them, than an Englishman
means when he subscribes himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
your most obedient humble servant, at the
conclusion of a letter.</p>

<p>A Frenchman not only means nothing
beyond common civility, by the plentiful
shower of compliments which he pours on
every stranger; but also, he takes it for
granted, that the stranger knows that nothing
more is meant. These expressions
are fully understood by his own countrymen:
he imagines all the world are as well
informed; and he has not the smallest intention
to deceive. But if any man takes
these expressions in a literal sense, and believes
that people are in reality inspired
with friendship, or have fallen in love with
him at first sight, he will be very much
disappointed; especially if he expects strong
proofs of either.</p>

<p>Yet he has no right to accuse the French
of insincerity, or breach of friendship.—Friendship
is intirely out of the question.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
They never intended to convey any other
idea, than that they were willing to receive
him on the footing of an acquaintance;—and
it was the business of his language-master
to have informed him of the
real import of their expressions.</p>

<p>If the same words indeed were literally
translated into English, and used by one
Englishman to another, the person to whom
they were addressed, would have good reason
to imagine that the other had a particular
regard for him, or meant to deceive
him; because the established modes of civility
and politeness in England do not require
such language.</p>

<p>The not making a proper allowance for
different modes and usages which accident
has established, is one great cause of the
unfavourable and harsh sentiments, which
the people of the different countries of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
the world too often harbour against each
other.</p>

<p>You may say, perhaps, that this superfluity
of compliments which the French
make use of, is a proof of the matter in
question; that the French have less sincerity
than their neighbours. By the same rule
we must conclude, that the common people
of every nation, who use few complimental
phrases in their discourse, have a
greater regard to truth, and stronger sentiments
of friendship, than those in the
middle and higher ranks. But this is what
I imagine it would be difficult to prove.</p>

<p>These complimental phrases, which have
crept into all modern languages, may, perhaps,
be superfluous; or, if you please,
absurd: but they are so fully established,
that people of the greatest integrity must
use them, both in England and in France;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
with this difference, that a smaller proportion
will do in the language of the one
country, than in that of the other; but they
are indications of friendship in neither.</p>

<p>Friendship is a plant of slow growth, in
every climate. Happy the man who can
rear a few, even where he has the most
settled residence. Travellers, passing through
foreign countries, seldom take time to cultivate
them; if they be presented with
some flowers, although of a flimsy texture
and quicker growth, they ought to accept
of them with thankfulness, and not quarrel
with the natives, for choosing to retain
the other more valuable plant for their
own use.</p>

<p>Of all travellers, the young English nobility
and gentry have the least right to
find fault with their entertainment while
on their tours abroad; for such of them as
show a desire of forming a connection with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
the inhabitants, by even a moderate degree
of attention, are received upon easier terms
than the travellers from any other country.
But a very considerable number of our
countrymen have not the smallest desire of
that nature: they seem rather to avoid
their society, and accept with reluctance
every offer of hospitality. This happens
partly from a prejudice against foreigners
of every kind; partly from timidity or
natural reserve; and in a great measure
from indolence, and an absolute detestation
of ceremony and restraint. Besides, they
hate to be obliged to speak a language of
which they seldom acquire a perfect command.</p>

<p>They frequently, therefore, form societies
or clubs of their own, where all ceremony
is dismissed, and the greatest ease and
latitude allowed in behaviour, dress, and
conversation. There they confirm each
other in all their prejudices, and with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
united voice condemn and ridicule the customs
and manners of every country but
their own.</p>

<p>By this conduct the true purpose of travelling
is lost or perverted; and many English
travellers remain four or five years
abroad, and have seldom, during all this
space, been in any company but that of
their own countrymen.</p>

<p>To go to France and Italy, and there
converse with none but English people, and
merely that you may have it to say that
you have been in those countries, is certainly
absurd: Nothing can be more so, except
to adopt with enthusiasm the fashions,
fopperies, taste, and manners of those
countries, and transplant them to England,
where they never will thrive, and where
they always appear aukward and unnatural.
For after all his efforts of imitation, a travelled
Englishman is as different from a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
Frenchman or an Italian, as an English
mastiff is from a monkey or a fox: And if
ever that sedate and plain meaning dog
should pretend to the gay friskiness of the
one, or to the subtilty of the other, we
should certainly value him much less than
we do.</p>

<p>But I do not imagine that this extreme
is by any means so common as the former.
It is much more natural to the English
character to despise foreigners than to imitate
them. A few tawdry examples to the
contrary, who return every winter from the
continent, are hardly worth mentioning as
exceptions.</p>

<p class="right">Paris.</p>

<p>Your acquaintance B—— has been in
Paris for these three weeks past. I
cannot conceive how he has remained so
long; for he has a very bad opinion of
this nation, and is fraught with the
strongest prejudice against French manners
in general: He considers all their
politesse as impertinence, and receives
their civilities as a prelude to the picking
of his pocket.</p>

<p>He and I went this forenoon to a review
of the foot-guards, by Marshal Biron.
There was a crowd; and we could with
difficulty get within the circle so as to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
conveniently. An old officer of high rank
touched some people who stood before us,
saying,—Ces deux Messieurs sont des étrangers;
upon which they immediately made
way, and allowed us to pass.—Don’t you
think that was very obliging? said I.—Yes,
answered he; but, by heavens, it was very
unjust.</p>

<p>We returned by the Boulevards, where
crowds of citizens, in their holiday dresses,
were making merry; the young dancing
cotillons, the old beating time to the music,
and applauding the dancers, all in a
careless oblivion of the past, thoughtless of
the future, and totally occupied with the
present.—These people seem very happy,
said I.—Happy! exclaimed B——; if they
had common sense or reflection, they would
be miserable. Why so?—Could not the
minister, answered he, pick out half a dozen
of them, if he pleased, and clap them into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
the Bicetre?—That is true indeed, said I;
that is a catastrophe which, to be sure, may
very probably happen, and yet I thought
no more of it than they.</p>

<p>We met, a few days after he arrived, at
a French house where we had both been
invited to dinner. There was an old lady
of quality present, next to whom a young
officer was seated, who paid her the utmost
attention.—He helped her to the dishes
she liked, filled her glass with wine or water,
and addressed his discourse particularly
to her.—What a fool, says B——, does that
young fellow make of the poor old woman!
If she were my mother, d—n me,
if I would not call him to an account for
it.—</p>

<p>Though B—— understands French, and
speaks it better than most Englishmen, he
had no relish for the conversation, soon left
the company, and has refused all invitations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
to dinner ever since. He generally
finds some of our countrymen who dine
and pass the evening with him at the Parc
Royal.</p>

<p>After the review this day, we continued
together, and being both disengaged, I proposed,
by way of variety, to dine at the
public ordinary of the Hôtel de Bourbon.
He did not like this much at first.—I
shall be teased, says he, with their confounded
ceremony:—But on my observing,
that we could not expect much ceremony
or politeness at a public ordinary, he agreed
to go.</p>

<p>Our entertainment turned out different,
however, from my expectations and his
wishes: A marked attention was paid us
the moment we entered; every body seemed
inclined to accommodate us with the best
places. They helped us first, and all the
company seemed ready to sacrifice every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
little conveniency and distinction to the
strangers: For, next to that of a lady, the
most respected character at Paris is that of
a stranger.</p>

<p>After dinner, B—— and I walked into
the gardens of the Palais Royal.</p>

<p>There was nothing real in all the fuss
those people made about us, says he.</p>

<p>I can’t help thinking it something, said
I, to be treated with civility and apparent
kindness in a foreign country—by strangers
who know nothing about us, but that we
are Englishmen, and often their enemies.</p>

<p>But their politeness consists in trifles,
said he.—In what consists any body’s politeness?
rejoined I.—The utmost a
Frenchman will do for you, added he, is
to endeavour to amuse you, and make your
time pass agreeably while you remain in
his country. And I think that no trifle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
answered I.—There are so many sources of
uneasiness and vexation in this life, that I
cannot help having a good will, and even
gratitude, to all those who enable me to
forget them:—For such people alleviate my
pain, and contribute to my happiness.</p>

<p>But these Frenchmen, rejoined he, do
not care a farthing for you in their hearts.—And
why should I care a farthing for
that? said I.—We have nothing to do with
their hearts.—You do not expect a friend in
every agreeable acquaintance.</p>

<p>But they are an interested set of people;
and even those among them who pretend
to be your friends,—do it only for some
selfish end.</p>

<p>That is only an assertion, said I, but no
proof.—If you stood in need of pecuniary
assistance, they would not advance you a
louis to save you from a jail, continued he.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>I hope never to be perfectly convinced
of that, said I;—but if we were to cultivate
friendship from the idea of assistance
of that nature, it would be doing exactly
what you accuse them of: Besides, continued
I, the power and opportunity of obliging
our acquaintances and friends by
great, and, what are called, essential services,
seldom occur; but those attentions
and courtesies, which smooth the commerce
between man and man, and sweeten social
life, are in every body’s power, and there
are daily and hourly occasions of displaying
them,—particularly to strangers.—Curse
their courtesies, said he, they are the greatest
<i>Bore</i> in nature.—I hate the French.—They
are the enemies of England, and a
false, deceitful, perfidious—But as we did
not come over, interrupted I, to fight them
at present, we shall suspend hostilities till a
more convenient season; and in the mean
time, if you have no objection, let us go to
the play.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>He agreed to this proposal, and here our
conversation ended.</p>

<p>You know B—— is as worthy a fellow
as lives; and, under a rough address,
conceals the best disposition in the world.
His manner, I imagine, was originally assumed
from a notion, which he has in common
with many people, that great politeness,
and apparent gentleness of behaviour,
are generally accompanied with falsehood
and real coldness;—even inhumanity of
character,—as if human nature, like marble,
took a polish proportionable to its
hardness.</p>

<p>This idea is certainly formed without an
accurate examination, and from a superficial
view of mankind. As a boorish address
is no proof of honesty, so is politeness
no indication of the reverse;—and if they
are once reduced to an equality in this
particular, it is evident that the latter is
preferable in every other respect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>But to return to the French; I am clearly
of opinion, that a stranger may fairly
avail himself of every conveniency arising
from their obliging manners, although he
should be convinced that all their assiduity
and attention are unconnected with any regard
to him, and flow entirely from vanity
and self-love. He may perceive that his Parisian
friend, while he loads him with civilities,
is making a display of his own proficiency
in the science of politeness, and
endeavouring to thrust himself forward in
the good opinion of the company, by yielding
the preference on a thousand trifling
occasions.—Though he plainly sees, that
all this stooping is with a view to conquer,
why should he repine at a victory which is
accompanied with so many conveniencies
to himself? why quarrel with the motive
while he feels the benefit of the effect?</p>

<p>If writers or preachers of morality could,
by the force of eloquence, eradicate selfishness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
from the hearts of men, and make
them in reality love their neighbours as
themselves, it would be a change devoutly
to be wished. But until that blessed event,
let us not find fault with those forms and
attentions which create a kind of artificial
friendship and benevolence, which for many
of the purposes of society produce the same
effects as the true.</p>

<p>People who love to amuse themselves
with play, and have not ready money, are
obliged to use counters. You and I, my
friend, as long as we cut and shuffle together,
shall never have occasion for such a
succedaneum;—I am fully persuaded we
are provided, on both sides, with a sufficient
quantity of pure gold.</p>

<h2 id="LETTER_XII">LETTER XII.</h2>

<p class="right">Paris.</p>

<p>When B—— and I went to the playhouse,
as was mentioned in my last,
we found a prodigious crowd of people before
the door: We could not get a place
till after a considerable struggle. The play
was the Siege of Calais, founded on a popular
story, which must needs be interesting
and flattering to the French nation.</p>

<p>You cannot conceive what pressing and
crowding there is every night to see this
favourite piece, which has had the same
success at Versailles as at Paris.</p>

<p>There are some few critics, however,
who assert that it is entirely devoid of merit
and owes its run to the popular nature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
of the subject, more than to any intrinsic
beauty in the verses, which some declare
are not even good French.</p>

<p>When it was last acted before the King,
it is said, his Majesty, observing that the
Duc d’Ayen did not join in applauding,
but that he rather shewed some marks of
disgust, turned to the Duke and said, Vous
n’applaudissez pas? Vous n’étes pas bon
François, Monsieur le Duc:—To this the
Duke replied,—à Dieu ne plaise que je ne
fusse pas meilleur que les vers de la piéce.</p>

<p>Obedient to the court in every other
particular, the French disregard the decisions
pronounced at Versailles in matters of
taste. It very often happens that a dramatic
piece, which has been acted before the
royal family and the court, with the highest
applause, is afterwards damned with
every circumstance of ignominy at Paris.
In all works of genius the Parisians lead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
the judgment of the courtiers, and dictate
to their monarch.</p>

<p>In other countries of Europe, it has happened,
that some Prince of superior talents
has, by the brightness of his own genius,
enlightened the minds of his subjects, and
dispelled the clouds of barbarism from his
dominions.</p>

<p>Since the commencement of this century
a great empire has been improved from a
state of gross ignorance, refined by the arts
of peace, and instructed in the arts of war,
by the vast genius and industry of one of
its Princes, who laid the foundation of its
present power and grandeur.</p>

<p>Another inconsiderable state, with fewer
resources, has, at a later period, been
created a powerful monarchy, by the astonishing
efforts, perseverance, and magnanimity
of its present king; whose love of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
knowledge and the arts has drawn some
of the greatest geniuses in Europe to his
capital; whence science and taste must gradually
flow through his whole dominions,
where they were formerly but little cherished.</p>

<p>In these instances, and others which
might be enumerated, the princes have
been superior in genius to any of their subjects.
The throne has been the source
whence knowledge and refinement have
flowed to the extremities of the nation.</p>

<p>But this has never been the case in
France, where it is not the king who polishes
the people;—but the people who
refine the manners, humanize the heart,
and, if it be not perfectly opaque, enlighten
the understanding of the king.</p>

<p>Telemaque, and many other works, have
been composed with this intention. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
many addresses and remonstrances to the
throne, excellent precepts and hints are
insinuated in an indirect and delicate
manner.</p>

<p>By the emphatic applause they bestow
on particular passages of the pieces represented
at the theatre, they convey to the
monarch the sentiments of the nation
respecting the measures of his government.</p>

<p>By ascribing qualities to him which he
does not possess, they endeavour to excite
within his breast a desire to attain them:
they try to cajole him into virtue. Considered
in this point of view, the design of
the equestrian statue which the city of
Paris has erected in honour of Lewis XV.
may have been suggested from a more generous
motive than flattery, to which it is
generally imputed. This was begun by
Bouchardon; who died when the work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
was well advanced, and has since been committed
to Pigal to be finished.</p>

<p>The horse is placed on a very high pedestal.
At the angles, are four figures,
standing in the manner of Caryatides, who
represent the four virtues, Fortitude, Justice,
Prudence, and the love of Peace. All
the ornaments are of Bronze.</p>

<p>The two small sides of the pedestal are
ornamented with gilded laurels and inscriptions.
On the front, towards the Thuilleries,
is the following:</p>

<p class="center">LUDOVICO XV.<br />
OPTIMO PRINCIPI<br />
QUOD<br />
AD SCALDUM, MOSAM, RHENUM,<br />
VICTOR<br />
PACEM ARMIS<br />
PACE<br />
SUORUM ET EUROPÆ<br />
FELICITATEM<br />
QUÆSIVIT.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>The large sides of the pedestal are adorned
with trophies and has reliefs. One represents
Lewis giving peace to Europe;
the other represents him in a triumphal
chariot, crowned by Victory, and conducted
by Renown to a people who submit.</p>

<p>When we recollect that the inscription
and emblems allude to the conclusion of
the war before the last, and what kind of
inscriptions are usually put under the statues
of kings, we shall not find any thing outrageously
flattering in the above; the moral
of which is, that the love of peace is
one of the greatest virtues a king can possess—The
best moral that can be insinuated
into the breast of a monarch.</p>

<p>In this work the horse is infinitely more
admired, by sculptors and satirists, than
the king. But the greatest oversight is,
that the whole group, though all the figures
are larger than life, have a diminutive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
appearance in the centre of the vast area in
which they are placed.</p>

<p>The wits of Paris could not allow such
an opportunity of indulging their vein to
escape unimproved. Many epigrams are
handed about.—Here are two:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Bouchardon est un animal,</div>
<div class="verse">Et son ouvrage fait pitié;</div>
<div class="verse">Il place les vices à cheval,</div>
<div class="verse">Et met les vertus à pied.</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Voilà notre Roi comme il est à Versailles,</div>
<div class="verse">Sans foi, sans loi, et sans entrailles.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Both are too severe; giving the idea of
wicked dispositions, and cruelty of temper,
which do not belong to Lewis the Fifteenth;
whose real character, in three
words, is that of a good-natured, easy-tempered
man, sunk in sloth and sensuality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>I have seen another inscription for the
statue handed about; it is in Latin, and
very short.</p>

<p class="center">STATUA STATUÆ.</p>

<p>You may imagine that the authors of
these would meet with a dreadful punishment,
if they were discovered. No danger
of that kind is sufficient to restrain the inhabitants
of this city, from writing and
spreading such pasquinades, which are
greatly relished by the whole nation.</p>

<p>Indeed, I imagine there is more of the
spirit of revenge, than of good policy, in
attempting to repel such humours; which,
if they did not get vent in this manner,
might break out in a more dangerous
shape.</p>

<h2 id="LETTER_XIII">LETTER XIII.</h2>

<p class="right">Paris.</p>

<p>I dined yesterday with an equal number
of both sexes, at the Chevalier B——’s.
He is F——’s very intimate friend, and
has a charming house within a few leagues
of Paris, which the Marquis makes full as
much use of as the owner.</p>

<p>The Chevalier has a considerable revenue,
which he spends with equal magnificence
and œconomy. He has been married many
years to his present lady, a most agreeable
woman, with whom he possesses every
thing which can make their union happy,
except children. They endeavour to forget
this disagreeable circumstance, by a
constant succession of company; and, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
is very singular here, the society entertained
by the husband and wife are the same.</p>

<p>F——, though much younger than
either, is a great favourite of both; and
they are always pleased when he invites a
small company of his friends to dine at
their house.</p>

<p>The present party was proposed by Madame
de M——, a rich young widow,
much admired here; of whom I shall give
you a glimpse, en passant—for do not
imagine I undertake to describe the most
undescribable of all human beings,—a
fine French lady.</p>

<p>Madame de M—— has some wit, more
beauty, and vivacity in the greatest measure:—if
there were a fourth degree of
comparison, I should place her vanity there.
She laughs a great deal, and she is in the
right; for her teeth are remarkably fine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
She talks very much, and in a loud and decisive
tone of voice.—This is not so judicious,
because her sentiments are not so brilliant as
her teeth, and her voice is rather harsh.—She
is received with attention and respect
every where;—that she owes to her rank.—She
is liked and followed by the men; this
she owes to her beauty. She is not disliked
by the women, which is probably owing
to her foibles.</p>

<p>This lady is thought to be fond of
F——: so, to prevent scandal, she desired
me to call at her house, and attend
her to the Chevalier’s.</p>

<p>I found her at her toilette, in consultation
with a general officer and two abbés,
concerning a new head-dress which she had
just invented.—It was smart and fanciful;
and, after a few corrections, received the
sanction of all those critics. They declared
it to be a valuable discovery, and foretold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
that it would immediately become the
general mode of Paris, and do immortal
honour to the genius of Madame de
M——.</p>

<p>She wheeled from before the glass,
with an air of exultation.—Allons, donc,
mes enfans—à la gloire,—cried she;
and was proceeding to give orders for her
equipage, when a servant entered, and informed
her, that Madame la Comtesse had
accepted her invitation, and would certainly
do herself the honour of dining with her.</p>

<p>I despair of giving you an idea of the
sudden change which this message occasioned
in the features of Madame de M——.
Had she heard of the death of her father, or
her only child, she could not have been
more confounded.—Est il possible (said she,
with an accent of despair) qu’on puisse être
si bête!—The servant was called, and examined
regarding the import of the answer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
he had brought from Madame la Comtesse.—It
was even so—she was assuredly to
come.—Fresh exclamations on the part of
Madame de M——. Did you send to invite
her for this day? said I.—Undoubtedly
I did, replied Madame de M——. That
could be delayed no longer.—She came to
town last Sunday.—I therefore sent her the
politest message in the world, begging to
have the honour of her company for this
day, at dinner; and behold, the horrid
woman (with a rudeness, or ignorance of
life without example) sends me word she
will come.</p>

<p>It is very shocking, indeed, said I, that
she should have misunderstood your kindness
so prodigiously.—Is it not, said she?
Could any mortal have expected so barbarous
a return of civility?—She is connected
with some of my relations in the
country:—when she came to town, I immediately
left my name with her porter.—She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
called next day on me—I had informed
my Swiss, that I was always to be out
when she came. I was denied accordingly.—Celà
est tout simple, et selon les
régles. The woman is twenty years older
than I, and we must be insupportable to
each other.—She ought to have seen, that
my invitation was dictated by politeness
only:—the same politeness on her part
should have prompted her to send a refusal.
In this manner we might have visited each
other, dined and supped together, and remained
on the most agreeable footing imaginable
through the whole course of our
lives:—but this instance of grosièreté must
put an end to all connection.—Well—there
is no remedy:—I must suffer purgatory
for this one day. Adieu.—Present
my compliments to Madame B——. Inform
her of this horrid accident.</p>

<p>Having condoled with Madame de M——
on her unmerited misfortune, I took my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
leave and joined F——, to whom I recounted
the sad chance which had deprived
us of that lady’s company.</p>

<p>He did not appear quite so unhappy as
she had on the occasion; but he swore he
was convinced that the Countess had accepted
the invitation to dinner par pure
malice; for, to his knowledge, she was
acquainted with their party to the Chevalier
B——’s, and had certainly seized that
opportunity of plaguing Madame de M——,
whom she hated. Without that douceur,
he imagined, the dinner would be as great
a purgatory to the Countess, as it could
possibly be to Madame de M——. How
these affectionate friends contrived to pass
their time together I know not, but we had
a most agreeable party at the Chevalier’s—the
Marquis entertaining the company
with the history of Madame M——’s misfortune,
and the loving tête à tête
which it had occasioned.—This he related<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
with such sprightliness, and described
his own grief and disappointment with
such a flow of good humour, as in some
degree indemnified the company for the
lady’s absence.</p>

<h2 id="LETTER_XIV">LETTER XIV.</h2>

<p class="right">Paris.</p>

<p>Though the gentleness of French
manners qualifies in some degree the
severity of the government; as I observed
in a former letter, still the condition of the
common people is by no means comfortable.</p>

<p>When we consider the prodigious resources
of this kingdom; the advantages it
enjoys above almost every other country in
point of soil, climate, and situation; the industry
and ingenuity of the inhabitants,
attached by affection to their Kings, and
submissive to the laws; we naturally expect
that the bulk of the nation should be at
their ease, and that poverty should be as
little known here as in any country of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
Europe. I do not speak of that ideal or
comparative poverty, the child of envy and
covetousness, which may be felt by the
richest citizens of London or Amsterdam;
or of the poverty produced in capitals by
gaming, luxury, and dissipation: But of
that actual poverty which arises when the
laborious part of a nation cannot acquire a
competent share of the necessaries of life by
their industry.</p>

<p>The two first flow from the vices and
extravagance of individuals:—The other
from a bad government.</p>

<p>Much of the first may be found in London,
where more riches circulate than in
any city of Europe; of the last there is
little to be seen in the country of England.</p>

<p>The reverse of this is the case in France,
where the poorest inhabitants of the capital
are often in a better situation than the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
laborious peasant. The former, by administering
to the luxuries, or by taking advantage
of the follies of the great and the
wealthy, may procure a tolerable livelihood,
and sometimes make a fortune; while the
peasant cannot, without much difficulty,
earn a scanty and precarious subsistence.</p>

<p>To have an adequate idea of the wealth
of England, we must visit the provinces,
and see how the nobility, the gentry, and
especially the farmers and country people
in general live. The magnificence of the
former, and the abundance which prevails
among the latter classes, must astonish the
natives of any other country in Europe.</p>

<p>To retain a favourable notion of the
wealth of France, we must remain in the
capital, or visit a few trading or manufacturing
towns; but must seldom enter the
chateau of the Seigneur, or the hut of the
peasant. In the one, we shall find nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
but tawdry furniture, and from the other
we shall be scared by penury.</p>

<p>A failure of crops, or a careless administration,
may occasion distress and scarcity
of bread among the common people at a
particular time: But when there is a permanent
poverty through various reigns, and
for a long tract of years, among the peasantry
of such a country as France; this
seems to me the surest proof of a careless,
and consequently an oppressive government.
Yet the French very seldom complain of
their government, though often of their
governors; and never of the King, but
always of the minister.</p>

<p>Although the enthusiastic affection which
the people of this nation once felt for their
present monarch be greatly abated, it is not
annihilated. Some of the courtiers indeed,
who are supposed to administer to the
King’s pleasures, are detested. The imprudent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
ostentatious luxury of the mistress, is
publicly execrated; but their censure of the
King, even where they think themselves
quite safe, never bursts out as it would in
some other nations, in violent expressions,
such as, Curse his folly,—his weakness, or—his
obstinacy. No: Even their censure of
him is intermingled with a kind of affectionate
regret.—Naturellement il est bon,
they say.—And when they observe the deplorable
anxiety and disgust in his countenance,
which are the concomitants of a
constitution jaded by pleasure, and of a
mind incapable of application, they cry,
Mon Dieu, qu’il est triste!—Il est malheureux
lui-même;—comment peut il
penser à nous autres?</p>

<p>I am persuaded, that, in spite of the discontent
which really subsists at present
in France, the King might recover the
esteem and affection of his subjects at once
by the simple manœuvre of dismissing his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
minister, and a few other unpopular characters.
A Lettre de cachet, ordering them
to banishment, or shutting them up in the
Bastille, would be considered as a complete
<i>revolution</i> of government, and the nation
would require no other <i>Bill of Rights</i> than,
what proceeded from this dreadful instrument
of tyranny.</p>

<p>As matters are at present, in my opinion,
no body of men in France has, properly
speaking, any rights. The Princes, the
noblesse, and the clergy, have indeed certain
privileges which distinguish them in
different degrees from their fellow-subjects:
but as for rights, they have none; or, which
amounts to the same thing, none which can
defend them, or which they can defend
against the Monarch, whenever he in his
royal wisdom chooses to invade or annihilate
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>A Frenchman will tell you, that their
parliaments have the right of remonstrating
to the throne upon certain occasions.—This
is a precious privilege indeed! the
common-council of London are in possession
of this glorious right also, and we all
know what it avails. It is like the power
of which Owen Glendower boasted—“calling
spirits from the vasty deep.”—But
the misfortune was, that none came in
consequence of his call.</p>

<p>The parliaments of Paris can indeed remonstrate;
and have done it with such
strength of reasoning and energy of expression,
that if eloquence were able to prevail
over unlimited power, every grievance
would have been redressed.</p>

<p>Some of these remonstrances display not
only examples of the most sublime and pathetic
eloquence, but also breathe a spirit
of freedom which would do honour to a
British House of Commons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>The resistance which the members of
the parliament of Paris made to the will of
the King, does them the greatest honour.
Indeed the lawyers in France have displayed
more just and manly sentiments of
government, and have made a nobler struggle
against despotic power, than any set of men
in the kingdom. It has therefore often
affected me with surprise and indignation,
to observe the attempts that are made here
to turn this body of men into ridicule.</p>

<p>One of this profession is never introduced
on the stage but in a ridiculous character.
This may give satisfaction to the prince,
whose power they have endeavoured to
limit, or to thoughtless slavish courtiers;
but ought to be viewed with horror by the
nation, for whose good the gentlemen of
the long-robe have hazarded so much; for
in their opposition to the court, much
personal danger was to be feared, and no
lucrative advantage to be reaped.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>Those who oppose the court measures in
our island incur, I thank Heaven, no personal
risk on that account.—A member of
the British parliament may launch his patriotic
bark in the most perfect security:—He
may glide down the current of inventive,
spread all his canvas, catch every
gale, and sail for an hour or two upon the
edge of treason, without any risk of being
sucked into its whirlpool. But though he
has nothing to fear, it is equally evident that
he has nothing to hope from such a voyage.
Opposition was formerly considered as a
means of getting into power: Mais nous
avons changé tout cela. Let any one recollect
the numbers who, with very moderate
abilities, have crawled on their knees
into office, and compare them with the
numbers and success of those who, armed
with genius and the artillery of eloquence,
attempt the places by storm; if, after this,
he joins the assailants, he must either act
from other motives than those of self-interest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
or betray his ignorance in the calculation
of chances.</p>

<p>The security, and even the existence, of
the parliament of Paris, depending entirely
on the pleasure of the King, and having
no other weapons, offensive or defensive,
but justice, argument, and reason, their
fate might have been foreseen—the usual
fate of those who have no other artillery
to oppose to power:—The members were
disgraced, and the parliament abolished.
The measure was considered as violent; the
exiles were regarded as martyrs; the people
were astonished and grieved. At length,
recovering from their surprise, they dissipated
their sorrow, as they do on all occasions
of great calamity,—by some very
merry songs.</p>

<h2 id="LETTER_XV">LETTER XV.</h2>

<p class="right">Paris.</p>

<p>My friend F—— called on me a few
days since, and as soon as he understood
that I had no particular engagement,
he insisted that I should drive somewhere
into the country, dine tête-à-tête with him,
and return in time for the play.</p>

<p>When we had drove a few miles I perceived
a genteel-looking young fellow,
dressed in an old uniform. He sat under a
tree, on the grass, at a little distance from
the road, and amused himself by playing
on the violin. As we came nearer we perceived
he had a wooden leg, part of which
lay in fragments by his side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>What do you there, soldier? said the
Marquis.—I am on my way home to my
own village, mon officier, said the soldier.—But,
my poor friend, resumed the Marquis,
you will be a furious long time before
you arrive at your journey’s end, if you
have no other carriage besides these, pointing
at the fragments of his wooden leg.—I
wait for my equipage and all my suite,
said the soldier; and I am greatly mistaken
if I do not see them this moment coming
down the hill.</p>

<p>We saw a kind of cart, drawn by one
horse, in which was a woman, and a peasant
who drove the horse.—While they
drew near, the soldier told us he had been
wounded in Corsica—that his leg had been
cut off—that before setting out on that expedition,
he had been contracted to a young
woman in the neighbourhood—that the
marriage had been postponed till his return;—but
when he appeared with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
wooden leg, that all the girl’s relations had
opposed the match.—The girl’s mother,
who was her only surviving parent, when
he began his courtship, had always been
his friend; but she had died while he was
abroad.—The young woman herself, however,
remained constant in her affections,
received him with open arms, and had
agreed to leave her relations, and accompany
him to Paris, from whence they intended
to set out in the diligence to the
town where he was born, and where his
father still lived:—That on the way to
Paris his wooden leg had snapped; which
had obliged his mistress to leave him, and
go to the next village in quest of a cart to
carry him thither, where he would remain
till such time as the carpenter should renew
his leg.—C’est un malheur, mon officier,
concluded the soldier, qui sera bientôt réparé—et
voici mon amie!—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>The girl sprang before the cart, seized
the outstretched hand of her lover, and
told him with a smile full of affection,—that
she had seen an admirable carpenter,
who had promised to make a leg that
would not break, that it would be ready by
the morrow, and they might resume their
journey as soon after as they pleased.</p>

<p>The soldier received his mistress’s compliment
as it deserved.</p>

<p>She seemed about twenty years of age, a
beautiful, fine-shaped girl—a Brunette,
whose countenance indicated sentiment and
vivacity.</p>

<p>You must be much fatigued, my dear,
said the Marquis.—On ne se fatigue pas,
Monsieur, quand on travaille pour ce qu’on
aime, replied the girl.—The soldier kissed
her hand with a gallant and tender air.—When
a woman has fixed her heart upon a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
man, you see, said the Marquis, turning to
me, it is not a leg more or less that will
make her change her sentiments.—Nor was
it his legs, said Fanchon, which made any
impression on my heart. If they had
made a little, however, said the Marquis,
you would not have been singular in your
way of thinking; but, allons, continued he,
addressing himself to me.—This girl is
quite charming—her lover has the appearance
of a brave fellow;—they have but
three legs betwixt them, and we have four;—if
you have no objection, they shall have
the carriage, and we will follow on foot to
the next village, and see what can be done
for these lovers.—I never agreed to a proposal
with more pleasure in my life.</p>

<p>The soldier began to make difficulties
about entering into the vis-à-vis.—Come,
come, friend, said the Marquis, I am a Colonel,
and it is your duty to obey: Get in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
without much ado, and your mistress shall
follow.</p>

<p>Entrons, mon bon ami, said the girl,
since these gentlemen insist upon doing us
so much honour.</p>

<p>A girl like you would do honour to the
finest coach in France. Nothing could
please me more than to have it in my
power to make you happy, said the Marquis,—Laisez
moi faire, mon Colonel, said
the soldier. Je suis heureuse comme une
reine, said Fanchon.—Away moved the
chaise, and the Marquis and I followed.</p>

<p>Voyez vous, combien nous sommes heureux
nous autres François à bon marché,
said the Marquis to me, adding with a
smile, le bonheur, à ce qu’on m’a dit, est
plus cher en Angleterre. But answered I,
how long will this last with these poor
people?—Ah, pour le coup, said he, voilà<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
une reflexion bien Angloise—that, indeed,
is what I cannot tell; neither do I know
how long you or I may live; but I fancy
it would be great folly to be sorrowful
through life, because we do not know how
soon misfortunes may come, and because
we are quite certain that death is to come
at last.</p>

<p>When we arrived at the inn to which
we had ordered the postilion to drive, we
found the soldier and Fanchon. After having
ordered some victuals and wine—Pray,
said I to the soldier, how do you propose
to maintain your wife and yourself?—One
who has contrived to live for five years on
soldier’s pay, replied he, can have little difficulty
for the rest of his life.—I can play
tolerably well on the fiddle, added he, and
perhaps there is not a village in all France
of the size, where there are so many marriages
as in that in which we are going to
settle—I shall never want employment.—And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
I, said Fanchon, can weave hair
nets and silk purses, and mend stockings.
Besides, my uncle has two hundred livres
of mine in his hands, and although he is
brother-in-law to the Bailiff, and <i>volontiers
brutal</i>, yet I will make him pay it every
sou.—And I, said the soldier, have fifteen
livres in my pocket; besides two louis that
I lent to a poor farmer to enable him to
pay the taxes, and which he will repay me
when he is able.</p>

<p>You see, Sir, said Fanchon to me, that
we are not objects of compassion.—May
we not be happy, my good friend (turning
to her lover with a look of exquisite tenderness),
if it be not our own fault?—If
you are not, ma douce amie! said the soldier
with great warmth, je ferai bien à
plaindre.—I never felt a more charming
sensation.—The tear trembled in the Marquis’s
eye.—Ma foi, said he to me, c’est
une comédie larmoyante—Then, turning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
to Fanchon, Come hither, my dear, said
he, till such time as you can get payment
of the two hundred livres, and my friend
here recovers his two louis, accept of this
from me, putting a purse of louis into her
hand—I hope you will continue to love
your husband, and to be loved by him.—Let
me know from time to time how your
affairs go on, and how I can serve you.
This will inform you of my name, and
where I live. But if ever you do me the
pleasure of calling at my house at Paris,—be
sure to bring your husband with you;
for I would not wish to esteem you less or
love you more than I do this moment.
Let me see you sometimes; but always
bring your husband along with you.—I
shall never be afraid to trust her with you,
said the soldier:—She shall see you as often
as she pleases, without my going with her.</p>

<p>It was by too much venturing (as your
serjeant told me) that you lost your leg,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
my best friend, said Fanchon, with a smile,
to her lover. Monsieur le Colonel n’est
que trop aimable. I shall follow his advice
literally, and when I have the honour
of waiting on him, you shall always attend
me.</p>

<p>Heaven bless you both, my good friends,
said the Marquis; may he never know
what happiness is who attempts to interrupt
your felicity!—It shall be my business
to find out some employment for you,
my fellow-soldier, more profitable than
playing on the fiddle. In the mean time,
stay here till a coach comes, which shall
bring you both this night to Paris; my
servant shall provide lodgings for you, and
the best surgeon for wooden legs that can
be found. When you are properly equipped,
let me see you before you go home. Adieu,
my honest fellow; be kind to Fanchon;
She seems to deserve your love. Adieu,
Fanchon; I shall be happy to hear that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
you are as fond of Dubois two years hence
as you are at present. So saying, he shook
Dubois by the hand, saluted Fanchon,
pushed me into the carriage before him,
and away we drove.</p>

<p>As we returned to town, he broke out
several times into warm praises of Fanchon’s
beauty, which inspired me with
some suspicion that he might have further
views upon her.</p>

<p>I was sufficiently acquainted with his
free manner of life, and I had a little
before seen him on the point of being
married to one woman, after he had arranged
every thing, as he called it, with
another.</p>

<p>To satisfy myself in this particular, I
questioned him in a jocular style on this
subject.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>No, my friend, said he, Fanchon shall
never be attempted by me.—Though
I think her exceedingly pretty, and of that
kind of beauty too that is most to my taste;
yet I am more charmed with her constancy
to honest Dubois, than with any
other thing about her: If she loses that,
she will lose her greatest beauty in my
eyes. Had she been shackled to a morose,
exhausted, jealous fellow, and desired a redress
of grievances, the case would have
been different; but her heart is fixed upon
her old lover Dubois, who seems to be a
worthy man, and I dare say will make her
happy. If I were inclined to try her, very
probably it would be in vain:—The constancy
which has stood firm against absence,
and a cannon-ball, would not be overturned
by the airs, the tinsel, and the jargon of a
petit-maître.—It gives me pleasure to
believe it would not, and I am determined
never to make the trial.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>F—— never appeared so perfectly
amiable.</p>

<p>B—— called and supped with me the
same evening. I was too full of the adventure
of Fanchon and Dubois not to
mention it to him, with all the particulars
of the Marquis’s behaviour.—This
F—— of yours, said he, is an honest fellow.
Do—contrive to let us dine with
him to-morrow.—By the bye, continued
he after a little pause, are not those
F——’s originally from England?—I
think I have heard of such a name in Yorkshire.</p>

<p class="right">Adieu.</p>

<p>I am uneasy when I hear people assert,
that mankind always act from motives
of self-interest. It creates a suspicion that
those who maintain this system, judge of
others by their own feelings. This conclusion,
however, may be as erroneous as
the general assertion; for I have heard it
maintained (perhaps from affectation) by
very disinterested people, who, when pushed,
could not support their argument without
perverting the received meaning of
language.—Those who perform generous
or apparently disinterested actions, say they,
are prompted by selfish motives—by the
pleasure which they themselves feel.—There
are people who have this feeling so
strong, that they cannot pass a miserable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
object without endeavouring to assist him.—Such
people really relieve themselves when
they relieve the wretched.</p>

<p>All this is very true: but is it not a
strange assertion, that people are not benevolent,
because they cannot be otherwise?</p>

<p>Two men are standing near a fruit-shop
in St. James’s street. There are some pine-apples
within the window, and a poor woman,
with an infant crying at her empty
breast, without. One of the gentlemen
walks in, pays a guinea for a pine-apple,
which he calmly devours; while the woman
implores him for a penny, to buy her
a morsel of bread—and implores in vain:
not that this fine gentleman values a penny;
but to put his hand in his pocket would
give him some trouble;—the distress of
the woman gives him none. The other
man happens to have a guinea in his pocket<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
also; he gives it to the woman, walks
home, and dines on beef-steaks, with his
wife and children.</p>

<p>Without doing injustice to the taste of
the former, we may believe, that the latter
received the greater gratification for his
guinea.—You will never convince me,
however, that his motive in bestowing it
was as selfish as the other’s.</p>

<p>Some few days after the adventure I
mentioned in my last letter, I met F——
and B—— at the opera. They had become
acquainted with each other at my
lodgings two days before, according to
B——’s desire.—It gave me pleasure to see
them on so good a footing.</p>

<p>F—— invited us to go home and sit
an hour with him before we went to bed;—to
which we assented.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>The Marquis then told us, we should
have the pleasure of seeing Fanchon, in her
best gown, and Dubois, with his new leg—for
he had ordered his valet to invite them,
with two or three of his companions, to a
little supper.</p>

<p>While the Marquis was speaking, his
coach drove up to the door of the opera—where
a well-known lady was at that moment
waiting for her carriage.</p>

<p>B—— seemed to recollect himself of a
sudden, saying, he must be excused from
going with us, having an affair of some
importance to transact at home.</p>

<p>The Marquis smiled—shook B——
by the hand—saying, c’est apparemment
quelque affaire qui regarde la constitution,
vivent les Anglois pour l’amour
patriotique.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>When we arrived at the Marquis’s, the
servants and their guests were assembled
in the little garden behind the hotel, and
dancing, by moon-light, to Dubois’s
music.</p>

<p>He and Fanchon were invited to a glass
of wine in the Marquis’s parlour.—The
poor fellow’s heart swelled at the sight of
his benefactor.—He attempted to express
his gratitude; but his voice failed, and he
could not articulate a word.</p>

<p>Vous n’avez pas à faire a des ingrats,
Monsieur le Colonel, said Fanchon. My
husband, continued she, is more affected
with your goodness, that he was by the
loss of his leg, or the cruelty of my relations.—She
then, in a serious manner,
with the voice of gratitude, and in the language
of Nature, expressed her own and her
husband’s obligations to the Marquis; and,
amongst others, she alluded to twenty louis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
which her husband had received <i>de sa part</i>
that very afternoon.—You intend to
make a saint of a sinner, my dear, said the
Marquis, and to succeed the better, you
invent false miracles. I know nothing of
the twenty louis you mention.—But I
know a great deal; for here they are in my
pocket, says Dubois.—The Marquis still
insisted they had not come from him.
The soldier then declared, that he had
called about one o’clock, to pay his duty
to Monsieur de F——; but not finding
him at home, he was returning to his
lodgings, when, in the street, he observed
a gentleman looking at him with attention,
who soon accosted him, demanding if his
name was not Dubois? If he had not lost
his leg at Corsica? and several other questions,
which being answered in the affirmative,
he slipped twenty louis into his
hand, telling him that it would help to
furnish his house.—Dubois in astonishment
had exclaimed—Mon Dieu! voilà<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
encore Monsieur de F——. Upon
which the stranger had replied:—Yes, he
sends you that, by me: and immediately
he turned into another street, and Dubois
saw no more of him.</p>

<p>We were all equally surprised at the
singularity of this little adventure. On
enquiring more particularly about the appearance
of the stranger, I was convinced
he could be no other than B——.</p>

<p>I remembered he had been affected with
the story of Dubois when I told it him.
You know B—— is not one of those, who
allow any emotions of that nature to pass
unimproved, or to evaporate in sentiment.
He generally puts them to some practical
use.—So having met Dubois accidentally
in the street, he had made him this
small present, in the manner above related;
and on his understanding that
Dubois and Fanchon were at F——’s,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
he had declined going, to avoid any explanation
on the subject.</p>

<p>Had our friend B—— been a man of
system, or much reflection, in his charity,
he would have considered, that as the soldier
had already been taken good care of,
and was under the protection of a generous
man, there was no call for his interfering
in the business; and he would probably
have kept his twenty guineas for some more
pressing occasion.</p>

<p>There are men in the world (and very
useful and most respectable men no doubt
they are), who examine the pro’s and the
con’s before they decide, upon the most
indifferent occasion; who are directed in
all their actions by propriety, and by the
general received notions of duty. They
weigh, in the nicest scales, every claim
that an acquaintance, a relation, or a
friend may have on them; and they endeavour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
to pay them on demand, as they
would a bill of exchange. They calculate
their income, and proportion every
expence; and hearing it asserted every
week from the pulpit, that there is exceeding
good interest to be paid one time
or other, for the money that is given to
the poor, they risk a little every year upon
that venture. Their passions, and their
affairs are always in excellent order; they
walk through life undisturbed by the misfortunes
of others. And when they come
to the end of their journey, they are decently
interred in a church-yard.</p>

<p>There is another set of men, who never
calculate; for they are generally guided
by the heart, which never was taught
arithmetic, and knows nothing of accounts.
Their heads have scarcely a vote
in the choice of their acquaintances; and
without the consent of the heart, most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
certainly none in their friendships. They
perform acts of benevolence, without recollecting
that this is a duty, merely for
the pleasure they afford; and perhaps forget
them, as they do their own pleasures,
when past.</p>

<p>As for little occasional charities, these
are as natural to such characters as breathing;
and they claim as little merit for the
one as for the other, the whole seeming
an affair of instinct rather than of reflection.</p>

<p>That the first of these two classes of
men is the most useful in society; that
their affairs will be conducted with most
circumspection; that they will keep out
of many scrapes and difficulties that the
others may fall into; and that they are
(if you insist upon it very violently)
the most virtuous of the two, I shall not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
dispute: Yet for the soul of me I cannot
help preferring the other; for almost all
the friends I have ever had in my life, are
of the second class.</p>

<h2 id="LETTER_XVII">LETTER XVII.</h2>

<p class="right">Paris.</p>

<p>Considering the natural gaiety and volatility
of the French nation, I have
often been surprised at their fondness for
tragedy, especially as their tragedies are
barren of incident, full of long dialogues,
and declamatory speeches;—and modelled
according to the strictest code of critical
legislation.</p>

<p>The most sprightly and fashionable people
of both sexes flock to these entertainments
in preference to all others, and
listen with unrelaxed gravity and attention.
One would imagine that such a serious,
correct and uniform amusement, would
be more congenial with the phlegm, and
saturnine dispositions of the English, than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
with the gay, volatile temper of the
French.</p>

<p>An English audience loves show, bustle
and incident, in their tragedies; and
have a mortal aversion to long dialogues
and speeches, however fine the sentiments,
and however beautiful the language
may be.</p>

<p>In this it would seem, that the two
nations had changed characters. Perhaps
it would be difficult to account for it in a
satisfactory manner. I shall not attempt
it. A Frenchman would cut the matter
short, by saying, that the Paris audience
has a more correct and just taste than that
of London; that the one could be amused
and delighted with poetry and sentiment,
while the other could not be kept awake
without bustle, guards, processions, trumpets,
fighting, and murder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>For my own part, I admire the French
Melpomene more in the closet than on the
stage. I cannot be reconciled to the
French actors of tragedy. Their pompous
manner of declaiming seems to me very
unnatural. The strut, and superb gestures,
and what they call la manière noble,
of their boasted Le Kain, appear, in my
eyes, a little outrè.</p>

<p>The justness, the dignified simplicity,
the energy of Garrick’s action, have destroyed
my relish for any manner different
from his. That exquisite, but concealed
art, that magic power, by which he could
melt, freeze, terrify the soul, and command
the obedient passions as he pleased,
we look for in vain, upon our own, or any
other stage.</p>

<p>What Horace said of Nature, may be
applied with equal justice to that unrivalled
actor:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse indent2">——Juvat, aut impellit ad iram,</div>
<div class="verse">Aut ad humum mœrore gravi deducit, et angit.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>One of the most difficult things in acting
is the player’s concealing himself behind
the character he assumes: The instant
the spectator gets a peep of him, the whole
illusion vanishes, and the pleasure is succeeded
by disgust. In Oedipus, Mahomet,
and Orosmane, I have always detected Le
Kain; but I have seen the English Roscius
represent Hamlet, Lear, Richard, without
recollecting that there was such a person
as David Garrick in the world.</p>

<p>The French tragedians are apt in my
opinion <i>to overstep the modesty of nature</i>.
Nature is not the criterion by which their
merit is to be tried.—The audience measures
them by a more sublime standard,
and if they come not up to that, they cannot
pass muster.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>Natural action, and a natural elocution,
they seem to think incompatible with dignity,
and imagine that the hero must announce
the greatness of his soul by supercilious
looks, haughty gestures, and a hollow
sounding voice. Such easy familiar
dialogue as Hamlet holds with his old
school-fellow Horatio, appears to them low,
vulgar, and inconsistent with the dignity of
tragedy.</p>

<p>But if simplicity of manners be not inconsistent
in real life, with genius, and the
most exalted greatness of mind, I do not
see why the actor who represents a hero,
should assume gestures which we have no
reason to think were ever in use in any age,
or among any rank of men.</p>

<p>Simplicity of manners, however, is so far
from being inconsistent with magnanimity,
that the one for the most part accompanies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
the other. The French have some reason
to lean to this opinion; for two of the
greatest men their nation ever produced
were remarkable for the simplicity of their
manners. Henry IV. and Maréchal Turenne
were distinguished by that, as well
as by their magnanimity and other heroic
virtues.</p>

<p>How infinitely superior in real greatness
and intrinsic merit, were those men to the
strutting ostentatious Lewis, who was always
affecting a greatness he never possessed,—till
misfortune humbled his mind to the
standard of humanity? Then indeed, throwing
away his pageantry and bluster, he assumed
true dignity, and for the first time
obtained the admiration of the judicious.
In the correspondence with de Torcy,
Lewis’s letters, which it is now certain
were written and composed by himself,
prove this, and display a soundness of judgement
and real greatness of mind which seldom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
appeared in the meridian of what they
call his glory.</p>

<p>What Lewis was (in the height of his
prosperity) to Henry in the essential qualities
of a King and Hero, such is Le Kain
to Garrick as an actor.</p>

<p>The French stage can boast at present of
more than one actress who may dispute
the laurel of tragedy with Mrs. Yates, or
Mrs. Barry.</p>

<p>In comedy, the French actors excel, and
can produce at all times a greater number
far above mediocrity, than are to be found
on the English stage.</p>

<p>The national character and manners of
the French give them perhaps advantages
in this line; and besides, they have more
numerous resources to supply them with
actors of every kind. In all the large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
trading and manufacturing towns, of which
there are a great number in France, there
are playhouses established. The same thing
takes place in most of the frontier towns,
and wherever there is a garrison of two or
three regiments.</p>

<p>There are companies of French comedians
also at the northern courts, in all the
large towns of Germany, and at some of
the courts of Italy. All of these are academies
which educate actors for the Paris
stage.</p>

<p>In genteel comedy particularly, I imagine
the French actors excel ours. They
have in general more the appearance of
people of fashion.</p>

<p>There is not such a difference between
the manners and behaviour of the people
of the first rank, and those of the middle
and lower ranks, in France as in England.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
Players therefore, who wish to catch the
manners of people of high rank and fashion,
do not undertake so great a task in the one
country as in the other.</p>

<p>You very seldom meet with an English
servant who could pass for a man of quality
or fashion; and accordingly very few people
who have been in that situation ever appear
on the English stage: But there are
many <i>valets de place</i> in Paris so very polite,
so completely possessed of all the little etiquettes,
fashionable phrases, and usual airs
of the <i>beau monde</i>, that if they were set off by
the ornaments of dress and equipage, they
would pass in many of the courts of Europe
for men of fashion, très polis,—bien
aimables,—tout-à-fait comme il faut, et
avec infiniment d’esprit; and could be detected
only at the court of France, or by
such foreigners as have had opportunities
of observing, and penetration to distinguish,
the genuine ease, and natural politeness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
which prevail among the people of rank in
this country.</p>

<p>In the character of a lively, petulant,
genteel petit-maître of fashion, Mollé excels
any actor in London.</p>

<p>The superiority of the French in genteel
comedy is still more evident with regard
to the actresses. Very few English
actresses have appeared equal to the parts
of Lady Betty Modish, in The Careless
Husband, or of Millamant, in The Way of
the World. Gross absurdity, extravagant
folly and affectation are easily imitated;
but the elegant coquetry, the lively, playful,
agreeable affectation of these two finely
imagined characters, require greater powers.
I imagine, however, from the execution I
have observed in similar parts, that there are
several actresses on the French stage at present
who could do them ample justice. Except
Mrs. Barry and Mrs. Abington, I know no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
actress in England who could give an adequate
idea of all that Congreve meant in
Millamant.</p>

<p>It is remarkable, that the latter also excels
in a character the most perfectly opposite
to this, that of an ill taught, aukward,
country girl. Perhaps there is no such
young lady in France as Congreve’s Miss
Prue: but if there were many such originals,
no actress in that kingdom could give
a copy more exquisite than Mrs. Abington’s.</p>

<p>In low comedy the French are delightful.
I can form no notion of any thing superior
to Preville in many of his parts.</p>

<p>The little French operas which are given
at the Comedie Italienne are executed in a
much more agreeable manner than any
thing of the same kind at London. Their
ballettes also are more beautiful:—There is
a gentillesse and legèreté in their manner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
of representing these little fanciful pieces,
which make our singers and dancers appear
somewhat aukward and clumsy in the
companion.</p>

<p>As for the Italian pieces, they are now
performed only thrice a week, and the
French seem to have lost in a great measure
their relish for them. Carlin, the celebrated
Harlequin, is the only support of
these pieces. You are acquainted with the
wonderful naïveté and comic powers of
this man, which make us forget the extravagance
of the Italian drama, and which
can create objects of unbounded mirth,
from a chaos of the most incoherent and
absurd materials.</p>

<p>An advantageous figure, a graceful manner,
a good voice, a strong memory, an accurate
judgment, are all required in a player:
Sensibility, and the power of expressing
the emotions of the heart by the voice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
and features, are indispensable. It seems
therefore unreasonable, not to consider that
profession as creditable, in which we expect
so many qualities united; while many
others are thought respectable, in which
we daily see people arrive at eminence
without common sense.</p>

<p>This prejudice is still stronger in France
than in England. In a company where
Mons. le Kain was, mention happened to
be made, that the King of France had just
granted a pension to a certain superannuated
actor. An officer present, fixing his eyes
on Le Kain, expressed his indignation at so
much being bestowed on a rascally player,
while he himself had got nothing. Eh,
Monsieur! retorted the actor, comptez-vous
pour rien la liberté de me parler ainsi?</p>

<p>I found myself so much hurried during
the last week of my stay at Paris, that
it was not in my power to write to you.</p>

<p>Ten thousand little affairs, which might
have been arranged much better, and performed
with more ease, had they been
transacted as they occurred, were all crowded,
by the slothful demon of procrastination,
into the last bustling week, and executed
in an imperfect manner.</p>

<p>I have often admired, without being able
perfectly to imitate, those who have the
happy talent of intermingling business with
amusement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>Pleasure and business contrast and give
a relish to each other, like day and night,
the constant vicissitudes of which are far
more delightful than an uninterrupted half
year of either would be.</p>

<p>To pass life in the most agreeable manner,
one ought not to be so much a man of
pleasure as to postpone any necessary business;
nor so much a man of business as to
despise elegant amusement. A proper mixture
of both forms a more infallible specific
against <i>tedium</i> and fatigue, than a constant
regimen of the most pleasant of the
two.</p>

<p>As soon as I found the D—— of H——
disposed to leave Paris, I made the necessary
arrangements for our departure, and a few
days after we began our journey.</p>

<p>Passing through Dijon, Chalons, Macon,
and a country delightful to behold, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
tedious to describe, we arrived on the fourth
day at Lyons.</p>

<p>After Paris, Lyons is the most magnificent
town in France, enlivened by industry,
enriched by commerce, beautified
by wealth, and by its situation, in the middle
of a fertile country, and at the confluence
of the Saone and the Rhone. The
numbers of inhabitants are estimated at
200,000. The theatre is accounted the
finest in France, and all the luxuries in
Paris are to be found at Lyons, though not
in equal perfection.</p>

<p>The manners and conversation of merchants
and manufacturers have been generally
considered as peculiar to themselves.
It is very certain that there is a striking
difference in these particulars between the
inhabitants of all the manufacturing and
commercial towns of Britain, and those of
Westminster. I could not remark the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
difference between the manners and address
of the people of Lyons and the courtiers of
Versailles itself.</p>

<p>There appeared to me a wonderful similitude
between the two. It is probable,
however, that a Frenchman would perceive
a difference where I could not. A foreigner
does not observe the different accents in
which an Englishman, a Scotchman, and
an Irishman speak English; neither perhaps
does he observe any difference between
the manners and address of the inhabitants
of Bristol, and those of Grosvenor-square,
though all these are obvious to a native of
England.</p>

<p>After a short stay at Lyons, we proceeded
to Geneva, and here we have remained
these three weeks, without feeling
the smallest inclination to shift the scene.
That I should wish to remain here is no
way surprising, but it was hardly to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
expected that the D—— of H—— would
have been of the same mind.—Fortunately,
however, this is the case.—I know no
place on the continent to which we could
go with any probability of gaining by the
change: The opportunities of improvement
here are many, the amusements are few
in number, and of a moderate kind: The
hours glide along very smoothly, and
though they are not always quickened by
pleasure, they are unretarded by languor
and unruffled by remorse.</p>

<p>As for myself, I have been so very often
and so miserably disappointed in my hopes
of happiness by change, that I shall not,
without some powerful motive, incline to
forego my present state of content, for the
chance of more exquisite enjoyments in a
different place or situation.</p>

<p>I have at length learnt by my own experience
(for not one in twenty profits by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
the experience of others), that one great
source of vexation proceeds from our indulging
too sanguine hopes of enjoyment
from the blessings we expect, and too much
indifference for those we possess. We
scorn a thousand sources of satisfaction
which we might have had in the interim,
and permit our comfort to be disturbed,
and our time to pass unenjoyed, from impatience
for some imagined pleasure at a
distance, which we may perhaps never obtain,
or which, when obtained, may change
its nature, and be no longer pleasure.
Young says,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">The present moment, like a wife, we shun,</div>
<div class="verse">And ne’er enjoy, because it is our own.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The devil thus cheats men both out of
the enjoyment of this life and of that which
is to come, making us in the first place
prefer the pleasures of this life to those of
a future state, and then continually prefer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
future pleasures in this life to those which
are present.</p>

<p>The sum of all these apophthegms
amounts to this:—We shall certainly remain
at Geneva till we become more tired of it
than at present.</p>

<h2 id="LETTER_XIX">LETTER XIX.</h2>

<p class="right">Geneva.</p>

<p>The situation of Geneva is in many respects
as happy as the heart of man
could desire, or his imagination conceive.
The Rhone, rushing out of the noblest lake
in Europe, flows through the middle of the
city, which is encircled by fertile fields, cultivated
by the industry, and adorned by the
riches and taste, of the inhabitants.</p>

<p>The long ridge of mountains called
Mount Jura on the one side, with the Alps,
the Glaciers of Savoy, and the snowy head
of Mont Blanc on the other, serve as boundaries
to the most charmingly variegated
landscape that ever delighted the eye.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>With these advantages in point of situation,
the citizens of Geneva enjoy freedom
untainted by licentiousness, and security
unbought by the horrors of wars.</p>

<p>The great number of men of letters,
who either are natives of the place, or have
chosen it for their residence, the decent
manners, the easy circumstances, and humane
dispositions of the Genevois in general,
render this city and its environs a very
desirable retreat for people of a philosophic
turn of mind, who are contented with moderate
and calm enjoyments, have no local
attachments or domestic reasons for preferring
another country, and who wish in
a certain degree to retire from the bustle
of the world, to a narrower and calmer
scene, and there for the rest of their days—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Ducere solicitæ jucunda oblivia vitæ.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>As education here is equally cheap and
liberal, the citizens of Geneva of both sexes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
are remarkably well instructed. I do not
imagine that any country in the world can
produce an equal number of persons (taken
without election from all degrees and professions)
with minds so much cultivated as
the inhabitants of Geneva possess.</p>

<p>It is not uncommon to find mechanics
in the intervals of their labour amusing
themselves with the works of Locke, Montesquieu,
Newton, and other productions
of the same kind.</p>

<p>When I speak of the cheapness of a liberal
education, I mean for the natives and
citizens only; for strangers now find every
thing dear at Geneva. Wherever Englishmen
resort, this is the case. If they do not
find things dear, they soon make them so.</p>

<p>The democratical nature of their government
inspires every citizen with an
idea of his own importance: He perceives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
that no man in the republic can insult, or
even neglect him, with impunity.</p>

<p>It is an excellent circumstance in any
government, when the most powerful man
in the state has something to fear from the
most feeble. This is the case here: The
meanest citizen of Geneva is possessed of
certain rights, which render him an object
deserving the attention of the greatest. Besides,
a consciousness of this makes him respect
himself; a sentiment, which, within
proper bounds, has a tendency to render a
man respectable to others.</p>

<p>The general character of human nature
forbids us to expect that men will always
act from motives of public spirit, without
an eye to private interest. The best form
of government, therefore, is that in which
the interest of individuals is most intimately
blended with the public good.—This
may be more perfectly accomplished in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
small republic than in a great monarchy.—In
the first, men of genius and virtue are
discovered and called to offices of trust by
the impartial admiration of their fellow-citizens—in
the other, the highest places
are disposed of by the caprice of the prince,
or of his mistress, or of those courtiers,
male or female, who are nearest his person,
watch the variations of his humour, and
know how to seize the smiling moments,
and turn them to their own advantage or
that of their dependents. Montesquieu
says, that a sense of honour produces the
same effects in a monarchy, that public spirit
or patriotism does in a republic: It must
be remembered, however, that the first, according
to the modern acceptation of the
word, is generally confined to the nobility
and gentry; whereas public spirit is a more
universal principle, and spreads through all
the members of the commonwealth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>As far as I can judge, a spirit of independency
and freedom, tempered by sentiments
of decency and the love of order, influence,
in a most remarkable manner, the
minds of the subjects of this happy republic.</p>

<p>Before I knew them, I had formed an
opinion, that the people of this place were
fanatical, gloomy-minded, and unsociable
as the puritans in England, and the presbyterians
in Scotland were, during the civil
wars, and the reigns of Charles II. and his
brother. In this, however, I find I had
conceived a very erroneous notion.</p>

<p>There is not, I may venture to assert, a
city in Europe where the minds of the
people are less under the influence of superstition
or fanatical enthusiasm than at Geneva.
Servetus, were he now alive, would
not run the smallest risk of persecution.
The present clergy have, I am persuaded,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
as little the inclination as the power of molesting
any person for speculative opinions.
Should the Pope himself chuse this city
for a retreat, it would be his own fault if
he did not live in as much security as at the
Vatican.</p>

<p>The clergy of Geneva in general are men
of sense, learning, and moderation, impressing
upon the minds of their hearers the
tenets of Christianity with all the graces
of pulpit eloquence, and illustrating the
efficacy of the doctrine by their conduct
in life.</p>

<p>The people of every station in this place
attend sermons and the public worship with
remarkable punctuality. The Sunday is
honoured with the most respectful decorum
during the hours of divine service; but
as soon as that is over, all the usual amusements
commence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>The public walks are crowded by all degrees
of people in their best dresses.—The
different societies, and what they call circles,
assemble in the houses and gardens of individuals.—They
play at cards and at bowls,
and have parties upon the lake with
music.</p>

<p>There is one custom universal here, and,
as far as I know, peculiar to this place:
The parents form societies for their children
at a very early period of their lives.
These societies consist of ten, a dozen, or
more children of the same sex, and nearly
of the same age and situation in life. They
assemble once a week in the houses of the
different parents, who entertain the company
by turns with tea, coffee, biscuits and
fruit; and then leave the young assembly
to the freedom of their own conversation.</p>

<p>This connection is strictly kept up
through life, whatever alterations may take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
place in the situations or circumstances of
the individuals. And although they should
afterwards form new or preferable intimacies,
they never entirely abandon this society;
but to the latest period of their lives
continue to pass a few evenings every year
with the companions of their youth and
their earliest friends.</p>

<p>The richer class of the citizens have
country-houses adjacent to the town, where
they pass one half of the year. These houses
are all of them neat, and some of them
splendid. One piece of magnificence they
possess in greater perfection than the most
superb villa of the greatest lord in any
other part of the world can boast, I mean
the prospect which almost all of them
command.—The gardens and vineyards of
the republic,—the Païs de Vaux;—Geneva
with its lake;—innumerable country-seats;—castles,
and little towns around the lake;—the
vallies of Savoy, and the loftiest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
mountains of the Alps, all within one
sweep of the eye.</p>

<p>Those whose fortunes or employments
do not permit them to pass the summer in
the country, make frequent parties of pleasure
upon the lake, and dine and spend the
evening at some of the villages in the environs,
where they amuse themselves with
music and dancing.</p>

<p>Sometimes they form themselves into
circles consisting of forty or fifty persons,
and purchase or hire a house and garden
near the town, where they assemble every
afternoon during the summer, drink coffee,
lemonade, and other refreshing liquors;
and amuse themselves with cards, conversation,
and playing at bowls; a game very
different from that which goes by the same
name in England; for here, instead of
a smooth level green, they often chuse
the roughest and most unequal piece of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
ground. The player, instead of rolling the
bowl, throws it in such a manner, that it
rests in the place where it first touches the
ground; and if that be a fortunate situation,
the next player pitches his bowl directly on
his adversary’s, so as to make that spring
away, while his own fixes itself in the spot
from which the other has been dislodged.—Some
of the citizens are astonishingly dexterous
at this game, which is more complicated
and interesting than the English
manner of playing.</p>

<p>They generally continue these circles till
the dusk of the evening, and the sound of
the drum from the ramparts call them to the
town; and at that time the gates are shut,
after which no person can enter or go out,
the officer of the guard not having the
power to open them, without an order
from the Syndics, which is not to be obtained
but on some great emergency.</p>

<p class="right">Geneva.</p>

<p>The mildness of the climate, the
sublime beauties of the country, and
the agreeable manners of the inhabitants,
are not, in my opinion, the greatest attractions
of this place.</p>

<p>Upon the same hill, in the neighbourhood
of Geneva, three English families at
present reside, whose society would render
any country agreeable.</p>

<p>The house of Mr. N—— is a temple of
hospitality, good humour, and friendship.</p>

<p>Near to him lives your acquaintance Mr.
U——. He perfectly answers your description,
lively, sensible, and obliging;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
and, I imagine, happier than ever you
saw him, having since that time drawn a
great prize in the matrimonial lottery.</p>

<p>Their nearest neighbours are the family
of Mr. L——. This gentleman, his lady
and children, form one of the most pleasing
pictures of domestic felicity I ever beheld.
He himself is a man of refined taste, a benevolent
mind, and elegant manners.</p>

<p>These three families, who live in the
greatest cordiality with the citizens of Geneva,
their own countrymen, and one
another, render the hill of Cologny the
most delightful place perhaps at this moment
in the world.</p>

<p>The English gentlemen, who reside in
the town, often resort hither, and mix
with parties of the best company of
Geneva.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>I am told, that our young countrymen
never were on so friendly and sociable a footing
with the citizens of this republic as at
present, owing in a great degree to the conciliatory
manners of these three families,
and to the great popularity of an English
nobleman, who has lived with his lady and
son in this state for several years.</p>

<p>I formerly mentioned, that all who live
in town, must return from their visits in
the country at sun-set, otherwise they are
certain of being shut out;—the Genevois
being wonderfully jealous of the external,
as well as the internal enemies of their independency.
This jealousy has been transmitted
from one generation to another,
ever since the attempt made by the Duke
of Savoy, in the year 1602, to seize upon
the town.</p>

<p>He marched an army, in the middle of
a dark night, in the time of peace, to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
gates, applied scaling ladders to the ramparts
and walls, and having surprised the
centinels, several hundreds of the Savoyard
soldiers had actually got into the
town, and the rest were following, when
they were at length discovered by a woman,
who gave the alarm.</p>

<p>The Genevois started from their sleep,
seized the readiest arms they could find,
attacked the assailants with spirit and
energy, killed numbers in the street, drove
others out of the gate, or tumbled them
over the ramparts, and the few who
were taken prisoners, they beheaded next
morning, without further process or ceremony.</p>

<p>The Genevois annually distinguish the
day on which this memorable exploit was
performed, as a day of public thanksgiving
and rejoicing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>It is called le jour de l’Escalade. There is
divine worship in all the churches.—The
clergymen, on this occasion, after
sermon, recapitulate all the circumstances
of this interesting event; put the audience
in mind of the gratitude they owe to Divine
Providence, and to the valour of their
ancestors, which saved them in so remarkable
a manner from civil and religious
bondage; enumerate the peculiar blessings
which they enjoy; and exhort them, in the
most pathetic strain, to watch over their
liberties, remain steady in their religion,
and transmit these, and all their other advantages,
unimpaired to their posterity.</p>

<p>The evening of the jour de l’Escalade is
spent in visiting, feasting, dancing, and all
kinds of diversions; for the Genevois seldom
venture on great festivity, till they
have previously performed their religious
duties—In this, observing the maxim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
of the Psalmist,—to join trembling with
their mirth.</p>

<p>The State keeps in pay a garrison of
six hundred mercenaries, who mount
guard and do duty every day. But they
do not trust the safety of the republic to
these alone. All citizens of Geneva are
soldiers. They are exercised several hours,
daily, for two months, every summer;
during which time they wear their uniforms,
and at the end of that period are
reviewed by the Syndics.</p>

<p>As they receive no pay, and as the officers
are their fellow-citizens, it cannot be
imagined that these troops will perform the
manual exercise and military evolutions,
with the exactness of soldiers who have no
other occupation, and who are under all
the rigour of military discipline.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>Nevertheless they make a very respectable
figure in the eyes even of disinterested
spectators; who are, however, but few in
number, the greater part consisting of their
own parents, wives and children. So, I
dare swear, there are no troops in the
world, who, at a review, are beheld
with more approbation than those of
Geneva.</p>

<p>Even a stranger of a moderate share of
sensibility, who recollects the connection
between the troops and the beholders, who
observes the anxiety, the tenderness, the
exultation, and various movements of the
heart, which appear in the countenances of
the spectators, will find it difficult to remain
unconcerned:—But sympathising
with all around him, he will naturally
yield to the pleasing emotions, and at
length behold the militia of Geneva with
the eyes of a citizen of the republic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>Geneva, like all free states, is exposed to
party-rage, and the public harmony is frequently
interrupted by political squabbles.
Without entering into a detail of the particular
disputes which agitate them at present,
I shall tell you in general, that one
part of the citizens are accused of a design
of throwing all the power into the hands
of a few families, and of establishing a
complete aristocracy. The other opposes
every measure which is supposed to have
that tendency, and by their adversaries are
accused of seditious designs.</p>

<p>It is difficult for strangers who reside
here any considerable time, to observe a
strict neutrality. The English in particular
are exceedingly disposed to take part
with one side or other; and as the government
has not hitherto attempted to bribe
them, they generally attach themselves to
the opposition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>Walking one afternoon with a young
nobleman, who, to a strong taste for natural
philosophy, unites the most passionate
zeal for civil liberty, we passed near the
garden, in which one of those circles which
support the pretensions of the magistracy
assemble. I proposed joining them. No,
said my Lord, with indignation; I will
not go for a moment into such a society:
I consider these men as the enemies of their
country, and that place as a focus for consuming
freedom.</p>

<p>Among the citizens themselves, political
altercations are carried on with great fire
and spirit. A very worthy old gentleman, in
whose house I have been often entertained
with great hospitality, declaiming warmly
against certain measures of the council,
asserted, that all those who had promoted
them deserved death; and if it depended
on him, they should all be hanged, without
loss of time. His brother, who was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
in that predicament, interrupted him, and
said, with a tone of voice which seemed to
beg for mercy, Good God! brother! surely
you would not push your resentment so far:
you would not actually hang them? Oui
assurément, replied the patriot, with a determined
countenance, et vous, mon très
cher frère, vous seriez le premier pendu
pour montrer mon impartialité.</p>

<p class="right">Geneva.</p>

<p>Although this republic has long
continued in a profound peace, and
there is no great probability of its being
soon engaged in bloody conflict, yet the
citizens of Geneva are not the less fond of
the pomp of war.</p>

<p>This appears in what they call their military
feasts, which are their most favourite
amusements, and which they take every
opportunity of enjoying.</p>

<p>I was present lately at a very grand entertainment
of this kind, which was given
by the King of the Arquebusiers upon his
accession to the royal dignity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>This envied rank is neither transmitted
by hereditary right, nor obtained by election;
but gained by skill and real merit.</p>

<p>A war with this state, like the war of
Troy, must necessarily consist of a siege.
The skilful use of the cannon and arquebuse
is therefore thought to be of the greatest
importance. During several months every
year, a considerable number of the citizens
are almost constantly employed in firing at
a mark, which is placed at a proper distance.</p>

<p>Any citizen has a right, at a small expence,
to make trial of his skill in this
way; and after a due number of trials,
the most expert marksman is declared
King.</p>

<p>There has not been a coronation of this
kind these ten years, his late Majesty having
kept peaceable possession of the throne<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
during that period. But this summer,
Mr. Moses Maudrier was found to excel in
skill every competitor; and was raised to
the throne by the unanimous voice of the
judges.</p>

<p>He was attended to his own house from
the field of contest by the Syndics, amidst
the acclamations of the people. Some time
after this, on the day of his feast, a camp
was formed on a plain, without the gates
of the city.</p>

<p>Here the whole forces of the republic,
both horse and foot, were assembled, and
divided into two distinct armies. They
were to perform a battle in honour of his
Majesty, all the combatants having previously
studied their parts.</p>

<p>This very ingenious, warlike drama had
been composed by one of the reverend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
ministers, who is said to possess a very extensive
military genius.</p>

<p>That the ladies and people of distinction,
who were not to be actually engaged,
might view the action with the greater ease
and safety, a large amphitheatre of seats was
prepared for them, at a convenient distance
from the field of battle.</p>

<p>Every thing being in readiness, the Syndics,
the Council, strangers of distinction,
and the relations and favourites of the King,
assembled at his Majesty’s palace, which is
a little snug house, situated in a narrow lane
in the lower part of the city. From the
palace, the procession set out in the following
order:</p>

<p>His Majesty walked first, supported by
the two eldest Syndics.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>In the next rank was the Duke of H——,
with the youngest.</p>

<p>After these, walked Lord St——pe, the
Prince Gallitzen,—Mr. Cl——ve, son to Lord
Cl——ve; Mr. Gr——lle, son to the late Minister;
Mr. St. L——, and many other
English gentlemen, who had been invited
to the feast.</p>

<p>Next to them came the Council of twenty-five;
and the procession was closed by the
King’s particular friends and relations.</p>

<p>In this order they marched through the
city, preceded by a band of music, who
played, as you may believe, the most
martial tunes they possibly could think
of.</p>

<p>When this company came to the field
where the troops were drawn up, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
were saluted by the officers; and having
made a complete circuit of both armies,
the King and all his attendants took their
seats at the amphitheatre, which had been
prepared for that purpose.</p>

<p>The impatience of the troops had been
very visible for some time. When the
King was seated, their ardour could be no
longer restrained. They called loudly to
their officers to lead them to glory.—The
signal was given.—They advanced to
the attack in the most undaunted manner.—Conscious
that they fought under
the eyes of their King, the Syndics, of
their wives, children, mothers and grandmothers,
they disdained the thoughts of
retreat.—They stood undisturbed by
the thickest fire. They smiled at the
roaring of the cannon, and like the horse
in Job, they cried among the trumpets,
ha, ha!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>The ingenious author of the battle had
taken care to diversify it with several entertaining
incidents.</p>

<p>An ambuscade was placed by one of the
armies, behind some trees, to surprise the
enemy.—This succeeded to a miracle,
although the ambuscade was posted in the
sight of both armies, and all the spectators.</p>

<p>A convoy with provisions, advancing
towards one of the armies, was attacked
by a detachment from the other; and after
a smart skirmish, one half of the waggons
were carried away by the assailants:—The
other remained with the troops for whom
they seemed to have been originally intended.</p>

<p>A wooden bridge was briskly attacked,
and as resolutely defended; but at length
was trod to pieces by both armies; for, in
the fury of the fight, the combatants forgot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
whether this poor bridge was their
friend or their foe. By what means it got
into the midst of the battle, I never could
conceive; for there was neither river,
brook, nor ditch in the whole field.</p>

<p>The cavalry on both sides performed
wonders.—It was difficult to determine
which of the generals distinguished himself
most. They were both dressed in
clothes exuberantly covered with lace;
for the sumptuary laws were suspended for
this day, that the battle might be as magnificent
as possible.</p>

<p>As neither of these gallant commanders
would consent to the being defeated, the
reverend author of the engagement could
not make the catastrophe so decisive and
affecting as he intended.</p>

<p>While Victory, with equipoised wings,
hovered over both armies, a messenger arrived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
from the town-hall with intelligence
that dinner was ready. This news quickly
spread among the combatants, and had an
effect similar to that which the Sabine women
produced when they rushed between
their ravishers and their relations.—The
warriors of Geneva relented at once; and
both armies suspended their animosity, in
the contemplation of that which they both
loved.—They threw down their arms,
shook hands, and were friends.</p>

<p>Thus ended the battle.—I don’t know
how it will affect you; but it has fatigued
me so completely, that I have lost all appetite
for the feast, which must therefore be
delayed till another post.</p>

<h2 id="LETTER_XXII">LETTER XXII.</h2>

<p class="right">Geneva.</p>

<p>The same company which had attended
the King to the field of battle, marched
with him in procession from that to the
Maison de Ville, where a sumptuous entertainment
was prepared.</p>

<p>This was exactly the reverse of a fête
champêtre, being held in the town-house,
and in the middle of the streets adjacent;
where tables were covered, and dinner provided,
for several hundreds of the officers
and soldiers.</p>

<p>The King, the Syndics, most of the
members of the Council, and all the strangers,
dined in the town-hall. The other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
rooms, as well as the outer court, were
likewise full of company.</p>

<p>There was much greater havoc at dinner
than had been at the battle, and the entertainment
in other respects was nearly as
warlike.</p>

<p>A kettle-drum was placed in the middle
of the hall, upon which a martial flourish
was performed at every toast. This was
immediately answered by the drums and
trumpets without the hall, and the cannon
of the bastion.</p>

<p>Prosperity to the republic is a favourite
toast:—When this was announced by the
first Syndic, all the company stood up with
their swords drawn in one hand, and glasses
filled with wine in the other.</p>

<p>Having drank the toast, they clashed their
swords, a ceremony always performed in
every circle or club where there is a public<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
dinner, as often as this particular toast
is named.—It is an old custom, and implies
that every man is ready to fight in
defence of the republic.</p>

<p>After we had been about two hours at
table, a new ceremony took place, which I
expected as little in the middle of a feast.
An hundred grenadiers, with their swords
drawn, marched with great solemnity into
the middle of the hall, for the tables being
placed in the form of a horse-shoe, there
was vacant space in the middle sufficient to
admit them.</p>

<p>They desired permission to give a toast:
This being granted, each of the grenadiers,
by a well-timed movement, like a motion
in the exercise, pulled from his pocket a
large water glass, which being immediately
filled with wine, one of the soldiers, in the
name of all, drank a health to King Moses
the first. His example was followed by his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
companions and all the company, and was
instantly honoured by the sound of the
drums, trumpets, and artillery.</p>

<p>When the grenadiers had drank this,
and a toast or two more, they wheeled
about, and marched out of the hall with
the same solemnity with which they had
entered, resuming their places at the tables
in the street.</p>

<p>Soon after this a man fantastically dressed
entered the hall, and distributed among the
company some printed sheets which seemed
to have come directly from the press.</p>

<p>This proved to be a song made for the
occasion, replete with gaiety, wit, and
good sense, pointing out, in a humorous
strain, the advantages which the citizens of
Geneva possessed, and exhorting them to unanimity,
industry, and public spirit.—This
ditty was sung by the man who brought it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
while many of the company joined in the
chorus.</p>

<p>When we descended from the town-hall,
we found the soldiers intermingled with
their officers, still seated at the tables in
the streets, and encircled by their wives
and children.</p>

<p>They all arose soon after, and dividing
into different companies, repaired to the
ramparts, the fields, and the gardens
where, with music and dancing, they continued
in high glee during the rest of the
evening.</p>

<p>The whole exhibition of the day, though
no very just representation of the manœuvres
of war, or the elegance of a court entertainment,
formed the most lively picture
of jollity, mirth, good-humour and cordiality,
that I had ever seen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>The inhabitants of a whole city,—of a
whole state if you please, united in one
scene of good fellowship, like a single family,
is surely no common sight.</p>

<p>If this sketch conveys one half of the
satisfaction to your mind, which the scene
itself afforded mine, you will not think
these two long letters tedious.</p>

<h2 id="LETTER_XXIII">LETTER XXIII.</h2>

<p class="right">Geneva.</p>

<p>There are some of the citizens of
Geneva themselves who deride the
little military establishment of the republic,
and declare it to be highly ridiculous in
such a feeble state to presume that they
could defend themselves. The very idea of
resistance against Savoy or France, they hold
as absurd.</p>

<p>They seem to take pleasure in mortifying
their countrymen, assuring them, that
in case of an attack all their efforts would
be fruitless, and their garrison unable to
stand a siege of ten days.</p>

<p>These politicians declaim against the
needless expence of keeping the fortifications<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
in repair, and they calculate the money
lost, by so many manufacturers being
employed in wielding useless firelocks,
instead of the tools of their respective professions.</p>

<p>Were I a member of this republic, I
should have no patience with these discouraging
malcontents, who endeavour to depress
the minds of their countrymen, and
embitter a source of real enjoyment.</p>

<p>I am convinced that the garrison, small
as it is, aided by the zeal of the inhabitants,
and regulated by that share of discipline
which their situation admits, would be sufficient
to secure them from a coup-de-main,
or any immediate insult, and might enable
them to defend the town from the attempts
of any one of the neighbouring states, till
they should receive succour from some of
the others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>Independent of these considerations, the
ramparts are most agreeable walks, convenient
for the inhabitants, and ornamental
to the city.</p>

<p>The exercising and reviewing the militia
form an innocent and agreeable spectacle to
the women and children, contribute to the
health and amusement of the troops themselves,
and inspire the inhabitants in general
with the pleasing ideas of security and of
their own importance.</p>

<p>Upon the whole, I am convinced that the
fortifications, and the militia of Geneva,
produce more happiness, in these various
ways taken together, than could be purchased
by all the money they cost, expended
in any other manner.</p>

<p>This I imagine is more than can be said
in favour of the greater part of the standing
armies on the continent of Europe,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
whose numbers secure the despotism of the
prince, whose maintenance is a most severe
burden upon the countries which support
them, and whose discipline, instead of exciting
pleasing emotions, impresses the mind
with horror.</p>

<p>The individuals who compose those armies
are miserable, by the tyranny exercised
on them, and are themselves the cause of
misery to their fellow-citizens by the tyranny
they exercise.</p>

<p>But it will be said they defend the nation
from foreign enemies.—Alas, could a
foreign conqueror occasion more wretchedness
than such defenders?—When he
who calls himself my protector has stripped
me of my property, and deprived me of my
freedom, I cannot return him very cordial
thanks, when he tells me, that he will defend
me from every other robber.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>The most solid security which this little
republic has for its independency, is founded
on the mutual jealousy of its neighbours.</p>

<p>There is no danger of its meeting with
the misfortune which has so lately befallen
Poland.—Geneva is such an atom of a state
as not to be divisible.</p>

<p>It serves, however, as a kind of barrier
or alarm-post to the Swiss Cantons, particularly
that of Bern, which certainly would
not like to see it in the hands either of the
King of France or of Sardinia.</p>

<p>The acquisition is not worth the attention
of the first; and it is better for
the second, that the republic should remain
in its present free and independent
situation, than that it should revert
to his possession, and be subjected to the
same government with his other dominions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>For no sooner would Geneva be in the
possession of Sardinia, than the wealthiest
of the citizens would abandon it, and carry
their families and riches to Switzerland,
Holland, or England.</p>

<p>Trade and manufactures would dwindle
with the spirit and independence of the inhabitants;
and the flourishing, enlightened,
happy city of Geneva, like other towns of
Piedmont and Savoy, would become the
residence of oppression, superstition, and
poverty.</p>

<p>In this situation it could add but little to
the King’s revenue; whereas, at present,
the peasants of his dominions resort in great
numbers to Geneva every market-day,
where they find a ready sale for all the productions
of their farms. The land is, on
this account, more valuable, and the peasants
are more at their ease, though the
taxes are very high, than in any other part
of Savoy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>This republic, therefore, in its present
independent state, is of more use to the King
of Sardinia, than if it were his property.</p>

<p>If a wealthy merchant should purchase a
piece of ground from a poor Lord, build a
large house, and form beautiful gardens
upon it, keep a number of servants, spend
a great part of his revenue in good housekeeping
and hospitality, the consumption
of his table, and many other articles,
being purchased from this Lord’s tenants,
it is evident that they would become rich,
and be able to pay a larger rent to their
landlord. This Lord would certainly act
against his own interest, if he attempted,
by law, chicane, or force, to dispossess the
proprietor of the house and gardens.</p>

<p>The free republic of Geneva is to the
King of Sardinia, exactly what the supposed
rich man would be to the poor Lord.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>It affords me satisfaction to perceive, that
the stability of this little fabric of freedom,
raised by my friends the citizens of Geneva,
does not depend on the justice and
moderation of the neighbouring powers, or
any equivocal support; but is founded on
the solid, lasting pillars of their mutual interest.</p>

<h2 id="LETTER_XXIV">LETTER XXIV.</h2>

<p class="right">Geneva.</p>

<p>I returned a few days since from a journey
to the Glaciers of Savoy, the Pays
de Vallais, and other places among the
Alps.</p>

<p>The wonderful accounts I had heard of
the Glaciers had excited my curiosity a
good deal, while the air of superiority assumed
by some who had made this boasted
tour, piqued my pride still more.</p>

<p>One could hardly mention any thing
curious or singular, without being told by
some of those travellers, with an air of cool
contempt—Dear Sir,—that is pretty well;
but, take my word for it, it is nothing to
the Glaciers of Savoy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>I determined at last not to take their
word for it, and I found some gentlemen
of the same way of thinking. The party
consisted of the Duke of H——, Mr. U——,
Mr. G——, Mr. K——, and myself.</p>

<p>We left Geneva early in the morning of
the third of August, and breakfasted at
Bonneville, a small town in the duchy of
Savoy, situated at the foot of Mole, and on
the banks of the river Arve.</p>

<p>The summit of Mole, as we were told,
is about 4600 English feet above the lake
of Geneva, at the lower passage of the
Rhone, which last is about 1200 feet above
the level of the Mediterranean. For these
particulars, I shall take the word of my informer,
whatever airs of superiority he may
assume on the discovery.</p>

<p>From Bonneville we proceeded to Cluse,
by a road tolerably good, and highly entertaining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
on account of the singularity
and variety of landscape to be seen from it.
The objects change their appearance every
moment as you advance, for the path is
continually winding, to humour the position
of the mountains, and to gain an access between
the rocks, which in some places
hang over it in a very threatening manner.
The mountains overlook and press so closely
upon this little town of Cluse, that when
I stood in the principal street, each end of
it seemed to be perfectly shut up; and
wherever any of the houses had fallen down,
the vacancy appeared to the eye, at a moderate
distance, to be plugged up in the
same manner by a green mountain.</p>

<p>On leaving Cluse, however, we found a
well-made road running along the banks of
the Arve, and flanked on each side by very
high hills, whose opposite sides tally so exactly,
as to lead one to imagine they have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
been torn from each other by some violent
convulsion of nature.</p>

<p>In other places one side of this defile is
a high perpendicular rock, so very smooth
that it seems not to have been torn by nature,
but chiselled by art, from top to bottom,
while the whole of the side directly
opposite is of the most smiling verdure.</p>

<p>The passage between the mountains gradually
opens as you advance, and the scene
diversifies with a fine luxuriancy of wild
landscape.</p>

<p>Before you enter the town of Sallenche,
you must cross the Arve, which at this season
is much larger than in winter, being
swoln by the dissolving snows of the
Alps.</p>

<p>This river has its source at the Parish of
Argentiere, in the valley of Chamouni, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
immediately augmented by torrents from
the neighbouring Glaciers, and pours its
chill turbid stream into the Rhone, soon
after that river issues from the lake of
Geneva.</p>

<p>The contrast between those two rivers is
very striking, the one being as pure and
limpid as the other is foul and muddy.
The Rhone seems to scorn the alliance, and
keeps as long as possible unmingled with
his dirty spouse. Two miles below the
place of their junction, a difference and
opposition between this ill-sorted couple
is still observable; these, however, gradually
abate by long habit, till at last,
yielding to necessity, and to those unrelenting
laws which joined them together,
they mix in perfect union, and flow
in a common stream to the end of their
course.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>We passed the night at Sallenche, and
the remaining part of our journey not admitting
of chaises, they were sent back to
Geneva, with orders to the drivers, to go
round by the other side of the lake, and
meet us at the village of Martigny, in the
Pays de Vallais.</p>

<p>We agreed with a muleteer at Sallenche,
who provided mules to carry us over the
mountains to Martigny. It is a good day’s
journey from Sallenche to Chamouni, not
on account of the distance, but from the
difficulty and perplexity of the road, and
the steep ascents and descents with which
you are teased alternately the whole way.</p>

<p>Some of the mountains are covered with
pine, oak, beech, and walnut trees. These
are interspersed with apple, plum, cherry,
and other fruit trees, so that we rode a great
part of the forenoon in shade.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>Besides the refreshing coolness this occasioned,
it was most agreeable to me on
another account. The road was in some
places so exceedingly steep, that I never
doubted but some of us were to fall; I
therefore reflected with satisfaction, that
those trees would probably arrest our course,
and hinder us from rolling a great way.</p>

<p>But many pathless craggy mountains remained
to be traversed after we had lost
the protection of the trees. We then had
nothing but the sagacity of our mules to
trust to. For my own part, I was very
soon convinced that it was much safer on
all dubious occasions to depend on their’s
than on my own: For as often as I was
presented with a choice of difficulties, and
the mule and I were of different opinions,
if, becoming more obstinate than he, I insisted
on his taking my track, I never failed
to repent it, and often was obliged to return<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
to the place where the controversy had
begun, and follow the path to which he
had pointed at first.</p>

<p>It is entertaining to observe the prudence
of these animals in making their way down
such dangerous rocks. They sometimes
put their heads over the edge of the precipice,
and examine with anxious circumspection
every possible way by which they
can descend, and at length are sure to fix
on that which upon the whole is the best.
Having observed this in several instances, I
laid the bridle on the neck of my mule, and
allowed him to take his own way, without
presuming to controul him in the smallest
degree.</p>

<p>This is doubtless the best method, and
what I recommend to all my friends in their
journey through life, when they have mules
for their companions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>We rested some time, during the sultry
heat of the day, at a very pleasingly situated
village called Serve; and ascending thence
along the steepest and roughest road we had
yet seen, we passed by a mountain, wherein,
they told us, there is a rich vein of copper,
but that the proprietors have left off working
it for many years.</p>

<p>As we passed through one little village,
I saw many peasants going into a church.—It
was some Saint’s day.—The poor
people must have half-ruined themselves
by purchasing gold-leaf.—Every thing was
gilded.—The virgin was dressed in a new
gown of gold paper;—the infant in her
arms was equally brilliant, all but the periwig
on his head, which was milk-white,
and had certainly been fresh powdered that
very morning.</p>

<p>I could scarcely refrain from smiling at
this ridiculous sight, which the people beheld<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
with as much veneration as they could
have shewn, had the originals been present.</p>

<p>Upon calling up my eyes to the cieling,
I saw something more extraordinary still:
This was a portrait of God the Father, sitting
on a cloud, and dressed like a Pope,
with the tiara on his head. Any one must
naturally be shocked at this, if he be not
at the same instant moved to laughter at the
infinite absurdity of the idea.</p>

<p>About six in the evening we arrived at
the valley of Chamouni, and found lodgings
in a small village called Prieuré. The
valley of Chamouni is about six leagues in
length, and an English mile in breadth. It
is bounded on all sides by very high mountains.
Between the intervals of these
mountains, on one side of the valley, the
vast bodies of snow and ice, which are called
Glaciers, descend from mount Blanc,
which is their source.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>On one side of the valley, opposite to the
Glaciers, stands Breven, a mountain whose
ridge is 5300 English feet higher than the
valley. Many travellers who have more
curiosity, and who think less of fatigue than
we, take their first view of the Glaciers from
the top of mount Breven. As there is only
the narrow valley between that and the
Glaciers, all of which it overlooks, and
every other object around, except Mont
Blanc, the view from it must be very advantageous
and magnificent.</p>

<p>We determined to begin with Montanvert,
from which we could walk to the
Glaciers, reserving Mount Breven for another
day’s work, if we should find ourselves
so inclined. After an hour’s refreshment
at our quarters, Mr. K—— and I took a
walk through the valley.</p>

<p>The chapter of Priests and Canons of
Sallenche have the lordship of Chamouni,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
and draw a revenue from the poor inhabitants;
the highest mountains of the Alps,
with all their ice and snow, not being sufficient
to defend them from rapacity and
extortion.</p>

<p>The priest’s house is beyond comparison
the best in the whole valley. Looking at
it, I asked a young man who stood near
me, if the priest was rich?</p>

<p>Oui, Monsieur, horriblement,—replied
he,—et aussi il mange presque tout notre
blé.</p>

<p>I then asked, if the people of Chamouni
wished to get rid of him?</p>

<p>Oui, bien de celui-ci—mais il faut avoir
un autre.</p>

<p>I do not see the absolute necessity of that,
said I.—Consider, if you had no priest,
you would have more to eat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>The lad stared—then answered with
great <i>naïveté</i>—Ah, Monsieur, dans ce pays-ci
les prêtres sont tout aussi nécessaires que
le manger.</p>

<p>It is plain, that this clergyman instructs
his parishioners very carefully in the principles
of religion.—I perceive, that your
soul is in very safe hands, said K——, giving
the boy a crown; but here is something
to enable you to take care of your body.</p>

<p>In my next I shall endeavour to give you
some account of the Glaciers:—At present,
I must wish you good night.</p>

<h2 id="LETTER_XXV">LETTER XXV.</h2>

<p class="right">Geneva.</p>

<p>We began pretty early in the morning
to ascend Montanvert, from the top
of which, there is easy access to the Glacier
of that name, and to the valley of
ice.</p>

<p>Our mules carried us from the inn across
the valley, and even for a considerable way
up the mountain; which at length became
so exceedingly steep, that we were obliged
to dismount and send them back, Mr.
U—— only, who had been here before, and
was accustomed to such expeditions, continued
without compunction on his mule
till he got to the top, riding fearless over
rocks, which a goat or a chamois would
have passed with caution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>In this last animal, which is to be found
on these mountains only, are blended the
different qualities of the goat and the
deer.—It is said to have more agility
than any other quadruped possessed of the
same degree of strength.</p>

<p>After ascending four hours, we gained
the summit of Montanvert. The day was
remarkably fine, the objects around noble
and majestic, but in some respects different
from what I had expected.</p>

<p>The valley of Chamouni had disappeared:—Mount
Breven seemed to have crept
wonderfully near; and if I had not just
crossed the plain which separates the two
mountains, and is a mile in breadth, I
should have concluded that their bases
were in contact, and that their distance
above was solely owing to the diminution
in the size of all mountains towards the
summit. Judging from the eye alone, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
should have thought it possible to have
thrown a stone from the place where I stood
to Mount Breven.</p>

<p>There is a chain of mountains behind
Montanvert, all covered with snow, which
terminate in four distinct rocks, of a
great height, having the appearance of
narrow pyramids or spires. They are
called the Needles; and each has a distinct
name.—Mont Blanc, surrounded by Montanvert,
Mount Breven, the Needles, and
other snowy mountains, appears like a
giant among pygmies.</p>

<p>The height which we had now attained,
was so far on our way up this mountain.
I was therefore equally surprised and mortified
to find, after an ascent of three
thousand feet, that Mont Blanc seemed
as high here as when we were in the
valley.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>Having ascended Montanvert from
Chamouni, on descending a little on the
other side, we found ourselves on a plain,
whose appearance has been aptly compared
to that which a stormy sea would have, if
it were suddenly arrested and fixed by a
strong frost. This is called the Valley of
Ice. It stretches several leagues behind
Montanvert, and is reckoned 2300 feet
higher than the valley of Chamouni.</p>

<p>From the highest part of Montanvert
we had all the following objects under our
eye, some of which seemed to obstruct
the view of others equally interesting;—the
Valley of Ice, the Needles, Mont
Blanc, with the snowy mountains below,
finely contrasted with Breven, and the green
hills on the opposite side of Chamouni, and
the sun in full splendor showing all of them
to the greatest advantage.—The whole
forms a scene equally sublime and beautiful,
far above my power of description,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
and worthy of the eloquence of that very
ingenious gentleman, who has so finely
illustrated these subjects, in a particular
treatise, and given so many examples of
both in his parliamentary speeches.</p>

<p>While we remained in contemplation of
this scene, some of the company observed,
that from the top of one of the Needles the
prospect would be still more magnificent,
as the eye could stretch over Breven, beyond
Geneva, all the way to Mount Jura,
and comprehend the Pays de Vallais, and
many other mountains and vallies.</p>

<p>This excited the ambition of the D——
of H——. He sprung up, and made towards
the Aiguille du Dru, which is the highest
of the four Needles. Though he bounded
over the ice with the elasticity of a young
chamois, it was a considerable time before
he could arrive at the foot of the Needle:—for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
people are greatly deceived as to distances,
in those snowy regions.</p>

<p>Should he get near the top, said Mr.
G——, looking after him with eagerness,
he will swear we have seen nothing—But
I will try to mount as high as he can;—I
am not fond of seeing people above me.
So saying, he sprung after him.</p>

<p>In a short time we saw them both scrambling
up the rock:—The D—— had
gained a considerable height, when he was
suddenly stopped by a part of the rock
which was perfectly impracticable (for his
impetuosity had prevented him from
choosing the easiest way); so Mr. G——
overtook him.</p>

<p>Here they had time to breathe and cool
a little. The one being determined not
to be surpassed, the other thought the exploit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
not worth his while, since the honour
must be divided. So like two rival powers,
who have exhausted their strength by a
fruitless contest, they returned, fatigued
and disappointed, to the place from which
they had set out.</p>

<p>After a very agreeable repast, on the
provisions and wine which our guides had
brought from the Prieuré, we passed, by an
easy descent, from the green part of Montanvert
to the Valley of Ice. A walk upon
this frozen sea is attended with inconveniencies.
In some places, the swellings,
which have been compared to waves, are
forty or fifty feet high: yet, as they are
rough, and the ice intermingled with snow,
one may walk over them. In other parts,
those waves are of a very moderate size,
and in some places the surface is quite
level.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>What renders a passage over this valley
still more difficult and dangerous is, the
rents in the ice, which are to be met with,
whatever direction you follow. These
rents are from two to six feet wide, and of
an amazing depth; reaching from the surface
of the valley, through a body of ice
many hundred fathoms thick. On throwing
down a stone, or any other solid substance,
we could hear the hollow murmur
of its descent for a very long time, sounding
like far distant waves breaking upon
rocks.</p>

<p>Our guides, emboldened by habit, skipped
over these rents without any sign of fear,
though they informed us, that they had
often seen fresh clefts formed, while they
walked on the valley. They added, indeed,
for our encouragement, that this was
always preceded by a loud continued noise,
which gave warning of what was to happen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>It is evident, however, that this warning,
though it should always precede the rent,
could be of little use to those who had advanced
to the middle of the valley; for they
neither could know certainly in what direction
to run, nor could they have time
to get off: and in case the ice should yawn
directly under their feet, they must inevitably
perish.—But probably few accidents
of that kind happen; and this has greater
influence, than any reasoning upon the
subject.</p>

<p>It is supposed, that the snow and ice
at the bottom melting by the warmth of
the earth, leave great vacancies, in the
form of vaults. These natural arches support
for a long time an amazing weight of
ice and snow;—for there is a vast distance
from the bottom to the surface of this
valley.—But the ice beneath continuing
to dissolve, and the snow above to increase,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
the arches must at last give way, which
occasions the noise and rents above mentioned.
Water, also, which may have
fallen from the surface into the clefts, or is
lodged by any means in this great mass of
snow, will, by its sudden expansion in the
act of freezing, occasion new rents at the
surface.</p>

<p>We had heard a great deal of the havoc
made by avalanches. These are formed of
snow driven by the winds against the
highest and most protuberant parts of rocks
and mountains, where it hardens and adheres
sometimes till a prodigious mass is
accumulated. But when these supporters
are able to sustain the increasing weight no
longer, the avalanche falls at once, hurrying
large portions of the loosened rock or
mountain along with it;—and rolling
from a vast height, with a thundering
noise, to the valley, involves in certain destruction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
all the trees, houses, cattle, and
men, which lie in its way<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>.</p>

<p>The greater part of those who have made
a journey to the Glaciers have seen one or
more of these avalanches in the very act of
falling, and have themselves always escaped
by miracle.—Just as most people who
have made a single voyage by sea, if it
were only between Dover and Calais, have
met with a storm, and very narrowly
escaped shipwreck.</p>

<p>All that any of our party can boast is,
that during the nights we lay at Chamouni,
we frequently heard a noise like distant
thunder, which we were told was occasioned
by the falling of some of these same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
avalanches at a few miles distance. And
during our excursions, we saw trees destroyed,
and tracts of soil torn from the
sides of the mountains, over which the
avalanches were said to have rolled, two
or three years before we passed. These
were the narrowest escapes we made.—I
heartily wish the same good luck to all
travellers, whatever account they themselves
may choose to give to their friends,
when they return.</p>

<p>The Valley of Ice is several leagues in
length, and not above a quarter of a league
in breadth. It divides into branches, which
run behind the chain of mountains formerly
taken notice of. It appears like a frozen
amphitheatre, and is bounded by mountains,
in whose clefts columns of crystal, as
we were informed, are to be found.—The
hoary majesty of Mont Blanc …
I was in danger of rising into poetry,
when recollecting the story of Icarus, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
thought it best not to trust to my own
waxen wings.—I beg leave rather to borrow
the following lines, which will please
you better than any flight of mine, and
prevent me from a fall:</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>Having walked a considerable time on
the valley, and being sufficiently regaled
with ice, we at length thought of returning
to our cottage at Prieuré. Our guides
led us down by a shorter and deeper way
than that by which we had ascended; and
in about two hours after we had begun our
descent, we found ourselves at the bottom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
of the mountain. This rapid manner of
descending, most people find more severe
upon the muscles of the legs and thighs,
than even the ascent. For my own part, I
was very near exhausted; and as we were
still a couple of miles distant from our
lodgings, it was with the greatest satisfaction
that I saw our obsequious mules in
waiting to carry us to our cottage; where
having at last arrived, and being assembled
in a small room, excluded from the view
of icy valleys, crystal hills, and snowy
mountains, with nothing before us but
humble objects, as cold meat, coarse bread,
and poor wine, we contrived to pass
an hour before going to bed, in talking
over the exploits of the day, and the
wonders we had seen.—Whether there is
greater pleasure in this, or in viewing the
scenes themselves, is a question not yet decided
by the casuists.</p>

<h2 id="LETTER_XXVI">LETTER XXVI.</h2>

<p class="right">Geneva.</p>

<p>There are five or six different Glaciers,
which all terminate upon one
side of the Valley of Chamouni, within
the space of about five leagues.</p>

<p>These are prodigious collections of snow
and ice, formed in the intervals or hollows,
between the mountains that bound the
side of the valley near which Mount Blanc
stands.</p>

<p>The snow in those hollows being screened
from the influence of the sun, the heat of
summer can dissolve only a certain portion
of it. These magazines of ice and snow
are not formed by what falls directly from
the heavens into the intervals. They are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
supplied by the snow which falls during
winter on the loftiest parts of Mont
Blanc; large beds or strata of which slide
down imperceptibly by their own gravity,
and finding no resistance at these intervals,
they form long irregular roots around all
the adjacent mountains.</p>

<p>Five of these enter, by five different embouchures,
into the valley of Chamouni,
and are called Glaciers, on one of which
we had been.</p>

<p>At present their surface is from a thousand,
or two thousand feet high, above
the valley.</p>

<p>Their breadth depends on the wideness
of the interval between the mountains in
which they are formed.</p>

<p>Viewed from the valley, they have, in
my opinion, a much finer effect than from
their summit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>The rays of the sun striking with various
force on the different parts, according
as they are more or less exposed, occasion
an unequal dissolution of the ice; and, with
the help of a little imagination, give the
appearances of columns, arches, and turrets,
which are in some places transparent.</p>

<p>A fabric of ice in this taste, two thousand
feet high, and three times as broad,
with the sun shining full upon it, you must
acknowledge to be a very singular piece of
architecture.</p>

<p>Our company ascended only the Glacier
of Montanvert, which is not the highest,
and were contented with a view of the
others from the valley; but more curious
travellers will surely think it worth their
labour, to examine each of them more particularly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>Some people are so fond of Glaciers, that
not satisfied with their present size, they
insist positively, that they must necessarily
grow larger every year, and they argue the
matter thus:</p>

<p>The present existence of the Glaciers is
a sufficient proof that there has, at some
period or other, been a greater quantity of
snow formed during the winter, than the
heat of the summer has been able to dissolve.
But this disproportion must necessarily increase
every year, and, of consequence, the
Glaciers must augment: because, any given
quantity of snow and ice remaining through
the course of one summer, must increase
the cold of the atmosphere around it in
some degree; which being reinforced by
the snows of the succeeding winter, will
refill: the dissolving power of the sun
more the second summer than the first,
and still more the third than the second,
and so on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>The conclusion of this reasoning is, that
the Glaciers must grow larger by an increasing
ratio every year, till the end of
time. For this reason, the authors of this
theory regret, that they themselves have
been sent into the world so soon; because,
if their birth had been delayed for nine or
ten thousand years, they should have seen
the Glaciers in much greater glory, Mont
Blanc being but a Lilliputian at present, in
comparison of what it will be then.</p>

<p>However rational this may appear, objections
have nevertheless been suggested,
which I am sorry for; because, when a
theory is tolerably consistent, well fabricated,
and goodly to behold, nothing can
be more vexatious, than to see a plodding
officious fellow overthrow the whole structure
at once, by a dash of his pen, as Harlequin
does a house with a touch of his
sword, in a pantomime entertainment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>Such cavillers say, that as the Glaciers
augment in size, there must be a greater
extent of surface for the sun-beams to act
upon, and, of consequence, the dissolution
will be greater, which must effectually prevent
the continual increase contended for.</p>

<p>But the other party extricate themselves
from this difficulty by roundly asserting,
that the additional cold occasioned by the
snow and ice already deposited, has a much
greater influence in retarding their dissolution,
than the increased surface can have in
hastening it: and in confirmation of their
system, they tell you, that the oldest inhabitants
of Chamouni remember the Glaciers
when they were much smaller than at
present; and also remember the time when
they could walk, from the Valley of Ice, to
places behind the mountains, by passages
which are now quite choked up with hills
of snow, not above fifty years old.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>Whether the inhabitants of Chamouni
assert this from a laudable partiality to the
Glaciers, whom they may now consider
(on account of their drawing strangers to
visit the Valley) as their best neighbours;—or
from politeness to the supporters of the
above-mentioned opinion;—or from real
observation, I shall not presume to say.—But
I myself have heard several of the old
people in Chamouni assert the fact.</p>

<p>The cavillers being thus obliged to relinquish
their former objection, attempt, in
the next place, to show, that the above
theory leads to an absurdity; because, say
they, If the Glaciers go on increasing in
bulk ad infinitum, the globe itself would
become in process of time a mere appendage
to Mont Blanc.</p>

<p>The advocates for the continual augmentation
of the Glaciers reply, that as
this inconveniency has not already happened,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
there needs no other refutation of
the impious doctrine of certain philosophers,
who assert that the world has existed
from eternity; and as to the globe’s
becoming an appendage to the mountain,
they assure us, that the world will be at an
end long before that event can happen. So
that those of the most timid natures, and
most delicate constitutions, may dismiss
their fears on that subject.</p>

<p>For my own part, though I wish well to
the Glaciers, and all the inhabitants of Chamouni,
having passed some days very pleasantly
in their company; I will take no
part in this controversy, the merits of which
I leave to your own judgment.</p>

<h2 id="LETTER_XXVII">LETTER XXVII.</h2>

<p class="right">Geneva.</p>

<p>The morning of the day on which we
departed from Prieuré, I observed a
girl of a very singular appearance sitting
before the door of one of the houses. When
I spoke to her, she made no answer: But
an elderly man, who had been a soldier in
the king of Sardinia’s service, and my acquaintance
since the moment of our arrival,
informed me, that this girl was an idiot,
and had been so from her birth.</p>

<p>He took me to two other houses in the
village, in each of which there was one person
in the same melancholy situation; and
he assured me, that all over the valley of
Chamouni, in a family consisting of five or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
six children, one of them, generally speaking,
was a perfect natural.</p>

<p>This was confirmed by some others, to
whom I afterwards mentioned it. I was
told at the same time, that the parents, so
far from considering this as a misfortune,
looked upon it as an indication of good
luck to the rest of the family, and no unhappiness
to the individual, whom they
always cherish and protect with the utmost
tenderness.</p>

<p>I asked my soldier, if any of his own
family were in that situation? Non, Monsieur,
answered he; et aussi j’ai passé une
vie bien dure.</p>

<p>Don’t you think these poor creatures
very unhappy?</p>

<p>Demande pardon, Monsieur:—Ils sont
très heureux—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>But you would not like to have been
born in that state yourself?</p>

<p>Vous croyez donc, Monsieur, que j’aurois
été bien attrapé?</p>

<p>Attrapé!—certainly:—don’t you think
so too?</p>

<p>Pour cela, non, Monsieur; je n’aurois
jamais travaillé.—</p>

<p>To one who has through life been obliged
to work hard for a bare subsistence,
labour appears the greatest evil, and perfect
idleness the greatest blessing. If this soldier
had been brought up in idleness, and had
experienced all the horrors and dejection
which attend indolent luxury, very possibly
he would be of a different opinion.</p>

<p>During this journey, I remarked, that in
some particular villages, and for a considerable
tract of country, scarcely was there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
any body to be seen who had that swelling
of the throat and neck, which is thought so
general among all the inhabitants of the
Alps. In particular, I did not observe any
body at Prieuré with this complaint; and,
upon enquiry, was informed, that there are
many parishes in which not a single person
is troubled with it, and that in other places
at no great distance it is almost universal.</p>

<p>In the valley of Chamouni there is only
one hamlet where it is common; but in
the Pays de Vallais, I was told, it is more
frequent than in any other place.</p>

<p>As this disease seems to be endemical, it
cannot, as has been imagined, proceed from
the drinking of water impregnated with
snow or ice; for this beverage is common
to all the inhabitants of the Alps, and of
other mountains.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>If the water be in reality the vehicle of
this disease, we must suppose it impregnated
not only with dissolved ice and snow, but
also with some salt, or other substance, possessed
of the noxious quality of obstructing
the glands of the throat; and we must also
suppose, that this noxious substance is to
be found in no other inhabited place but
the Alps.</p>

<p>After one of the inhabitants of Chamouni
had enumerated many parishes where
there were, and others where there were no
Goîtres (which is the name they give this
swelling), he concluded by telling me, I
should see them in great abundance among
the Valaisans, to whose country we were
going.—When I told the man, I thought
his country-people very happy, in being
quite free from such an odious disease,
which afflicted their poor neighbours—En
revanche, said the peasant, nous sommes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
accablés des impôts;—et dans le pays de
Vallais on ne paye rien.</p>

<p>The d——l is in the fellow, exclaimed
I.—Were it in your choice, would you accept
of Goîtres, to get free of taxes?</p>

<p>Très volontiers, Monsieur;—l’un vaut
bien l’autre.</p>

<p>You see, my friend, that it is not in
courts and capitals alone that men are discontented
with their fortunes. The causes
of repining are different in different places;
but the effect is the same every where.</p>

<p>On the morning of the sixth day, we bid
adieu to Prieuré; and having ascended the
mountains, which shut up the valley of
Chamouni at the end opposite to that by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
which we had entered, after various windings
on a very rugged road, we gradually
descended into a hollow of the most dismal
appearance.</p>

<p>It is surrounded with high, bare, rugged
rocks, without trees or verdure of any
kind, the bottom being as barren and craggy
as the sides, and the whole forming a most
hideous landscape. This dreary valley is
of a considerable length, but very narrow.
I imagine it would have pleased the fancy
of Salvator, who might have been tempted
to steal a corner of it for one of his pieces,
which, when he had enlivened with a murder
or two, would have been a master-piece
of the Horrible.</p>

<p>Having traversed this, we continued our
journey, sometimes ascending, then descending
into other vallies whose names
I have forgot.—We had a long continued
ascent over Mount Noir, a very high hill,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
covered with pine-trees, many of which
are above a hundred feet in height. I was
obliged to walk on foot most of this road,
which is full as steep as any part of that by
which we had ascended Montanvert.</p>

<p>We came at length to the pass which
separates the King of Sardinia’s country
from the little republic, called the Pays de
Vallais. Across this there is an old thick
wall, and a gate, without any guard. This
narrow pass continues for several miles.—A
few peasants arranged along the upper
part of the mountains could, by rolling
down stones, destroy a whole army, if it
should attempt to enter into the country by
this road.</p>

<p>When you have patted through this long
defile, the road runs along the side of a
high and steep mountain; but is still so
very narrow, that two persons cannot with
safety go abreast, and all passengers are entirely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
at the mercy of those who may be
posted on the higher parts of the mountain.</p>

<p>From the side of the mountain on which
we passed, we could have spoken to the
people who inhabited the side of the mountain
opposite. But I am convinced it would
have taken three or four hours walking, to
have gone to them: Because we must, by
a long, oblique tour, have first reached the
bottom of the cleft between us, and then
have ascended to them, by another long, fatiguing
path, which could not be done in
less time than I have mentioned.</p>

<p>Wherever there is a spot of the mountain
tolerably fertile, and the slope less formidable
than usual, you are almost certain to
find a peasant’s house. All the houses are
built of the fine red pine, which grows
near at hand. The carriage of this, even
for a short way, upon those very steep
mountains, must have been attended with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
no small difficulty and danger. These
dwellings are raised on wooden props, or
pillars, two or three feet above the ground.
On the top of each pillar a large flag or
broad stone is placed, to obstruct the entrance
of rats.—Indeed the situation of these
abodes is so very aerial, that they seem almost
inaccessible to every animal that has
not wings, as well as to rats.</p>

<p>The road led us at length to the summit,
which is level, and covered with pines for
several miles. Having traversed this, and
descended a little on the other side, the
lower Vallais opened to our view. Nothing
can be imagined more singularly picturesque:—It
is of an oval form, about
seven leagues in length, and one in breadth,
surrounded on all sides by mountains of a
stupendous height, the lower parts of which
are covered with very rich pasture.—The
valley itself is fertile in the highest degree,
finely cultivated, and divided into meadows,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
gardens, and vineyards. The Rhone flows
in beautiful mazes from the one end to the
other.—Sion, the capital of the Vallais, is
situated on the upper extremity, and the
town of Martigny on the lower, many villages
and detached houses appearing all
over the valley between them. The prospect
we had now under our eye formed a
striking and agreeable contrast with the
scenes we had just left. The distance from
this point to Martigny, which stands near
the bottom of the mountain, is about six
miles. There is one continued descent the
whole way, which is rendered easy by the
roads being thrown into a zig-zag direction.</p>

<p>After the rugged paths we had been accustomed
to, it was, comparatively speaking,
rest, to walk down this mountain.—We
arrived at Martigny refreshed, and in
high spirits.</p>

<h2 id="LETTER_XXVIII">LETTER XXVIII.</h2>

<p class="right">Geneva.</p>

<p>During our journey over the mountains
which encircle the lower Vallais,
I had often felt an inclination to enter some
of the peasants’ houses, that I might be a
witness of the domestic œconomy of a people
which Rousseau has so delightfully described.</p>

<p>Had I been alone, or with a single companion,
I should have pledged them liberally,
and made a temporary sacrifice of my
reason to the Penates of those happy mountaineers;
for, according to him, this is the
only payment they will receive for their
entertainment: But our company was by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
far too numerous, and would have put their
hospitality to too severe a trial.</p>

<p>After a night’s refreshment at Martigny,
we looked with some degree of impatience
for the cabriolets, which had been ordered
to meet us there. We all talked with rapture
of the sublime scenes from which we
had descended; yet nobody regretted that
the rest of the journey was to be performed
on plain ground. The cabriolets arriving
the same forenoon, we set out by the <i>embouchure</i>,
which leads to St. Maurice.</p>

<p>That immense rampart of mountains
which surrounds the Vallais at every other
part, is cut through here, which renders
that country accessible to the inhabitants of
the canton of Bern. This opening has
the appearance of a vast and magnificent
avenue, on each side of which a
row of lofty mountains are placed, instead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
of trees. It is some leagues in length.
The ground is exceedingly fertile, and perfectly
level: Yet if an attack were suspected,
this pass could be easily defended by
batteries at the bottom of the mountains
on each side. Besides, a river of considerable
depth flows along, sometimes on the
one side, and sometimes on the other, and,
by continually crossing the plain, seems to
forbid all hostile incroachments.</p>

<p>This little spot, the country of the Vallaisans,
which comprehends the valley above
described, the mountains that surround it,
and stretch on one side all the way to the
lake, including three or four towns and
many villages, is a district, governed by its
own laws and magistrates, in alliance with,
but independent of, the Swiss cantons, or
any other power. The religion is popery,
and the form of government democratic.—It
seems to have been imagined by Nature
as a last asylum for that divinity, without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
whose influence all her other gifts are of
small value. Should the rapacious hand of
despotism ever crush the rights of mankind,
and overturn the altars of <span class="smcapuc">FREEDOM</span>,
in every other country in Europe, a chosen
people may here preserve the true worship,
and share her regard with the provinces
beyond the Atlantic.</p>

<p>In the middle of the opening above mentioned,
about four leagues from Martigny,
between two high mountains, and at the
side of the Rhone, is situated the little town
of St. Maurice, which guards this entrance
into the lower Vallais.</p>

<p>Having passed a bridge at this town,
which divides the country of the Vallaisans
from the canton of Bern, we proceeded to
Bex, a village remarkable for its delightful
situation, and for the salt-works which
are near it. After dinner, we visited these.
We entered the largest saline by a passage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
cut out of the solid rock, of a sufficient
height and breadth to allow a man to walk
with ease.</p>

<p>Travellers who have the curiosity to explore
these gloomy abodes, are previously
furnished with lighted lamps or torches,
and dressed in a coarse habit, to defend them
from the slimy drippings which fall from
the roof and sides of the passage.</p>

<p>Upon arriving at the reservoir of salt
water, which is about three quarters of a
mile from the entrance, I was seized with
a nausea, from the disagreeable smell of the
place, and returned with all possible expedition
to the open air, leaving my companions
to push their researches as far as they
pleased. They remained a considerable
time after me. What satisfaction they received
within, I shall not take upon me
to determine; but I never saw a set of
people make a more melancholy exit;—with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
their greasy frocks, their torches, their
smoky, woe-begone countenances, they
put me in mind of a procession of condemned
heretics, walking to the flames, at
an Auto de Fè at Lisbon.</p>

<p>Having recovered their looks and spirits
at the inn at Bex, they allured me, that the
curiosities they had seen during their subterraneous
progress, particularly after my
secession, were more worthy of observation
than any thing we had met with since we
had left Geneva; and they all advised me,
with affected seriousness, to return and complete
the interesting visit which I had left
unfinished.</p>

<p>Next morning our company divided, the
D—— of H—— and Mr. G—— chusing to
return by Vevay and Lausanne. Mr U——,
Mr. K——, and myself, went by the other
side of the lake of Geneva. They took
with them the two chaises, and we proceeded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
on horseback, our road not admitting
of wheel-carriages.</p>

<p>We left Bex early in the morning, passing
through Aigle, a thriving little town,
whose houses are built of a white marble
found in the neighbourhood.—The ideas
of gloom and wretchedness, as well as of
magnificence, had somehow been linked
in my mind with this substance.—I don’t
know whether this is owing to its
being used in tombs and monuments;—or
to my having observed, that the houses
most profusely ornamented by it are so often
the mansions of dulness and discontent.—Whatever
gave rise to this connection
of ideas, the appearance of the inhabitants
of Aigle was well calculated to cure
me of the prejudice; for although the
meanest houses in this poor little town are
built of marble, yet in the course of my
life I never beheld less care and more satisfaction
in the countenances of any set of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
people. An appearance of ease and content
prevails not only here, but all over
Switzerland.</p>

<p>A little beyond Aigle, we crossed the
Rhone in boats. It is broader at this ferry,
than where it flows from the lake of Geneva.
As soon as we arrived on the other
side, we were again in the dominions of
the Vallaisans, which extend on this side all
the way to the lake.</p>

<p>We had a delightful ride to St. Gingo,
where we dined, and remained several
hours to refresh our horses. Though it
was Sunday, there was a fair at this town,
to which such a concourse of people had
resorted from the Pays de Vallais, the
canton of Bern, and from Savoy, that we
could not without difficulty find a room to
dine in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>The dress of the young Vallaisannes is
remarkably picturesque. A little silk hat,
fixed on one side of the head, from which
a bunch of ribbons hangs negligently, with
a jacket very advantageous to the shape,
gives them a smart air, and is upon the
whole more becoming than the dress of the
common people in any country I have yet
seen.</p>

<p>A little beyond St. Gingo, we entered
the dukedom of Savoy. The road is here
cut out of the lofty rocks which rise from
the lake of Geneva. It must be passed with
caution, being exceedingly narrow, and no
fence to prevent the traveller from falling
over a very high precipice into the lake, in
case his horse should start to one side.</p>

<p>At some places this narrow road is rendered
still more dangerous by fragments
which have fallen from the mountains
above, and have impaired and almost destroyed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
the path. At those places we were
obliged to dismount, and lead our horses,
with great attention, over rubbish and
broken rocks, till we gained those parts of
the road which were intire.</p>

<p>The sight of Meillerie brought to my
remembrance the charming letters of Rousseau’s
two lovers. This recollection filled
me with a pleasing enthusiasm. I sought
with my eyes, and imagined I discovered
the identical place where St. Preux sat with
his telescope to view the habitation of his
beloved Julia.—I traced in my imagination
his route, when he sprung from rock to
rock after one of her letters, which a sudden
gust of wind had snatched from his
hands.—I marked the point at which the
two lovers embarked to return to Clarence,
after an evening visit to those very rocks,—when
St. Preux, agonized with tender recollections,
and distracted with despair, was
tempted to seize his mistress, then the wife<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
of another, and precipitate himself along
with her, from the boat headlong into the
middle of the lake.</p>

<p>Every circumstance of that pathetic story
came fresh into my mind. I felt myself on
a kind of classic ground, and experienced
that the eloquence of that inimitable writer
had given me an interest in the landscape
before my eyes, beyond that which its own
natural beauties could have effected.</p>

<p>Having left the romantic rocks of Meillerie
behind, we descended to a fertile
plain, almost on a level with the lake,
along which the road runs, flanked with
rows of fine tall trees all the way to Evian,
an agreeable little town, renowned for its
mineral waters. Here we met with many
of our Geneva acquaintances of both sexes,
who had come, under pretence of drinking
the waters, to amuse themselves in this delightful
retreat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p>We next proceeded to Tonon, a most religious
city, if we may judge by the number
of churches and monasteries which it
contains. The number of inhabitants are
calculated at six or seven thousand, and
every seventh person I saw wore the uniform
of some religious order. After this,
I was not greatly surprised to perceive
every symptom of poverty among the lay
inhabitants.</p>

<p>Having bespoke supper and beds at this
place, we went and visited the convent
of Carthusians at Ripaille, which is at a
little distance.</p>

<p>It was here that a Duke of Savoy, after
a fortunate reign, assumed the character of
a hermit, and lived with the fathers a life
of piety and mortification, according to
some; of voluptuousness and policy, according
to others. What we are well assured
of is, that he was in a short time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
elected Pope, by the council of Basil, which
dignity he was obliged to relinquish nine
years after, having first made very honourable
conditions for himself. After this, he
spent the remainder of his life with the reputation
of great sanctity at Ripaille.</p>

<p>Had he been allowed to chuse any part
of Europe for his retreat, he could not
have found one more agreeable than this
which his own dominions furnished.</p>

<p>The fathers with great politeness showed
us their forest, their gardens, their apartments,
and a very elegant new chapel, which
is just finished. They then conducted us
into the chamber where their Sovereign had
lived and died. They talked much of his
genius, his benevolence, and his sanctity.
We heard them with every mark of acquiescence,
and returned to our inn, where
tho’ <i>we</i> certainly did not <i>faire Ripaille</i>, I’m
convinced the fleas did: As Shakespeare’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
carrier says, there was never a King in
Christendom better bit than we were,
through the whole night. We paid for
our entertainment, such as it was, a very
extravagant bill in the morning, and without
grudging; for we considered, that we
were to leave our host and his family
amongst a swarm of blood-suckers, still
more intolerable than fleas.</p>

<p>We arrived the same forenoon at Geneva,
having finished a tour in which a greater
variety of sublime and interesting objects
offer themselves to the contemplation of
the traveller, than can be found in any
other part of the globe of the same extent.</p>

<h2 id="LETTER_XXIX">LETTER XXIX.</h2>

<p class="right">Geneva.</p>

<p>I am not surprised that your inquiries of
late entirely regard the philosopher of
Ferney. This extraordinary person has
contrived to excite more curiosity, and to
retain the attention of Europe for a longer
space of time, than any other man this age
has produced, monarchs and heroes included.—Even
the most trivial anecdote
relating to him seems, in some degree, to
interest the Public.</p>

<p>Since I have been in this country, I
have had frequent opportunities of conversing
with him, and still more with those
who have lived in intimacy with him for
many years; so that, whatever remarks I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
may send you on this subject, are founded
either on my own observation, or on that
of the most candid and intelligent of his
acquaintance.</p>

<p>He has enemies and admirers here, as
he has every where else; and not unfrequently
both united in the same person.</p>

<p>The first idea which has presented itself
to all who have attempted a description of
his person, is that of a skeleton. In as far
as this implies excessive leanness, it is just;
but it must be remembered, that this skeleton,
this mere composition of skin and
bone, has a look of more spirit and vivacity,
than is generally produced by flesh
and blood, however blooming and youthful.</p>

<p>The most piercing eyes I ever beheld
are those of Voltaire, now in his eightieth
year. His whole countenance is expressive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
of genius, observation, and extreme
sensibility.</p>

<p>In the morning he has a look of anxiety
and discontent; but this gradually wears
off, and after dinner he seems cheerful:—yet
an air of irony never entirely forsakes
his face, but may always be observed
lurking in his features, whether he frowns
or smiles.</p>

<p>When the weather is favourable, he
takes an airing in his coach, with his niece,
or with some of his guests, of whom there
is always a sufficient number at Ferney.
Sometimes he saunters in his garden; or if
the weather does not permit him to go
abroad, he employs his leisure-hours in
playing at chess with Pere Adam; or in
receiving the visits of strangers, a continual
succession of whom attend at Ferney to
catch an opportunity of seeing him; or in
dictating and reading letters; for he still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
retains correspondents in all the countries
of Europe, who inform him of every remarkable
occurrence, and send him every
new literary production as soon as it appears.</p>

<p>By far the greater part of his time is
spent in his study; and whether he reads
himself, or listens to another, he always has
a pen in his hand, to take notes, or make
remarks.</p>

<p>Composition is his principal amusement.
No author who writes for daily bread, no
young poet ardent for distinction, is more
assiduous with his pen, or more anxious for
fresh fame, than the wealthy and applauded
Seigneur of Ferney.</p>

<p>He lives in a very hospitable manner, and
takes care always to keep a good cook. He
has generally two or three visitors from Paris,
who stay with him a month or six weeks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
at a time. When they go, their places are
soon supplied; so that there is a constant
rotation of society at Ferney. These, with
Voltaire’s own family, and his visitors from
Geneva, compose a company of twelve or
fourteen people, who dine daily at his table,
whether he appears or not. For when engaged
preparing some new production for
the press, indisposed or in bad spirits, he
does not dine with the company; but satisfies
himself with seeing them for a few
minutes, either before or after dinner.</p>

<p>All who bring recommendations from his
friends, may depend upon being received,
if he be not really indisposed.—He often
presents himself to the strangers, who assemble
almost every afternoon in his anti-chamber,
although they bring no particular
recommendation. But sometimes they are
obliged to retire without having their curiosity
gratified.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>As often as this happens, he is sure of
being accused of peevishness; and a thousand
ill-natured stories are related, perhaps
invented, out of revenge, because he is not
in the humour of being exhibited like a
dancing bear on a holiday. It is much less
surprising that he sometimes refuses, than
that he should comply so often. In him,
this complaisance must proceed solely from
a desire to oblige; for Voltaire has been so
long accustomed to admiration, that the
stare of a few strangers cannot be supposed
to afford him much pleasure.</p>

<p>His niece, Madame Denis, does the
honours of the table, and entertains the
company, when her uncle is not able, or
does not choose to appear. She is a well-disposed
woman, who behaves with good-humour
to every body, and with unremitting
attention and tenderness to her uncle.</p>

<p>The forenoon is not a proper time to visit
Voltaire. He cannot bear to have his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
hours of study interrupted. This alone is
sufficient to put him out of humour; besides,
he is then apt to be querulous,
whether he suffers by the infirmities of age
or from some accidental cause of chagrin.
Whatever is the reason, he is less an optimist
at that part of the day than at any
other.—It was in the morning, probably,
that he remarked,—que c’étoit dommage
que le quinquina se trouvoit en Amérique,
et la fièvre en nos climats.</p>

<p>Those who are invited to supper, have
an opportunity of seeing him in the most
advantageous point of view. He then exerts
himself to entertain the company, and
seems as fond of saying, what are called
good things, as ever:—and when any
lively remark or bon mot comes from
another, he is equally delighted, and pays
the fullest tribute of applause.—The
spirit of mirth gains upon him by indulgence.—When
surrounded by his friends,
and animated by the presence of women,
he seems to enjoy life with all the sensibility<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
of youth. His genius then surmounts
the restraints of age and infirmity, and
flows along in a fine strain of pleasing, spirited
observation, and delicate irony.</p>

<p>He has an excellent talent of adapting
his conversation to his company.—The first
time the D—— of H—— waited on him, he
turned the discourse on the ancient alliance
between the French and Scotch nations.—Reciting
the circumstance of one of his
Grace’s predecessors having accompanied
Mary Queen of Scots, whose heir he at
that time was, to the court of France,—he
spoke of the heroic characters of his
ancestors, the ancient Earls of Douglas—of
the great literary reputation of some of
his countrymen, then living; and mentioned
the names of Hume and Robertson
in terms of high approbation.</p>

<p>A short time afterwards, he was visited
by two Russian Noblemen, who are now at
Geneva. Voltaire talked to them a great
deal of their Empress, and the flourishing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
state of their country.—Formerly, said
he, your countrymen were guided by ignorant
priests,—the arts were unknown,
and your lands lay waste;—but now the
arts flourish, and the lands are cultivated.—One
of the young men replied, That there
was still a great proportion of barren land
in Russia.—At least, said Voltaire, you
must admit, that of late your country has
been very <i>fertile in laurels</i>.</p>

<p>His dislike to the clergy is well known.—This
leads him to join in a very trite topic
of abuse with people who have no pretension
to that degree of wit which alone
could make their railings tolerable.—The
conversation happening to turn into this
channel, one person said, If you substract
pride from priests, nothing will remain.—Vous
comptez donc, Monsieur, la gourmandise,
pour rien, said Voltaire.</p>

<p>He approves much more of Marmontel’s
Art of Poetry, than of any poems of that
author’s composition. Speaking of these,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
he said that Marmontel, like Moses, could
guide others to the Holy Land, though he
was not allowed to enter it himself<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>.</p>

<p>Voltaire’s unbecoming allusions to the
Sacred Writings, and his attempts to turn
into ridicule some of the most venerable
characters mentioned in them, are notorious.</p>

<p>A certain person, who stammered very
much, found means to get himself introduced
at Ferney.—He had no other recommendation
than the praises he very
liberally bestowed on himself.—When
he left the room Voltaire said, he supposed
him to be an avanturier, un imposteur.—Madame
Denis said, Impostors never stammer:—To<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
which Voltaire replied—Moïse,
ne begayoit-il pas?</p>

<p>You must have heard of the animosity
which has long subsisted between Voltaire
and Freron the Journalist at Paris. The
former was walking one day in his garden
with a gentleman from Geneva. A toad
crawled across the road before them:—The
gentleman, to please Voltaire, said, pointing
at the toad,—There is a Freron.—What
can that poor animal have done to you,
replied the Wit, to deserve such a name?</p>

<p>He compared the British nation to a
hogshead of their own strong beer; the
top of which is froth, the bottom dregs,
the middle excellent.</p>

<p>A friend of Voltaire’s having recommended
to his perusal, a particular system
of metaphysics, supported by a train of
reasonings, by which the author displayed
his own ingenuity and address, without
convincing the mind of the reader, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
proving any thing besides his own eloquence
and sophistry, asked, some time
after, the critic’s opinion of this performance?</p>

<p>Metaphysical writers, replied Voltaire,
are like minuet-dancers; who being dressed
to the greatest advantage, make a couple
of bows, move through the room in the finest
attitudes, display all their graces, are in
continual motion without advancing a step,
and finish at the identical point from which
they set out. Perhaps he borrowed this
thought from the following lines in Pope’s
Dunciad:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Or set on metaphysic ground to prance,</div>
<div class="verse">Show all his paces, not a step advance.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This, I hope, will satisfy you for the
present; in my next, I shall send you what
farther particulars I think worth your notice
concerning this singular man.—Mean
while, I am, &amp;c.</p>

know it, was long since made by Cowley—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="verse">Bacon like Moses led us forth at last</div>
<div class="verse">The barren wilderness he past,</div>

<h2 id="LETTER_XXX">LETTER XXX.</h2>

<p class="right">Geneva.</p>

<p>Considered as a matter, Voltaire appears
in a very amiable light. He is affable,
humane, and generous to his tenants and
dependants. He loves to see them prosper;
and takes part in their private and domestic
concerns, with the attention of a patriarch.—He
promotes industry and manufactures
among them, by every means he can
devise: by his care and patronage alone,
Ferney, from a wretched village, whose
inhabitants were sunk in sloth and poverty,
is become a flourishing and commodious
little town.</p>

<p>That acrimony, which appears in some
of Voltaire’s works, seems to be excited
only against rival wits, and contemporary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
writers, who refuse him that distinguished
place on Parnassus, to which his talents entitle
him.</p>

<p>If he has been the author of severe satire,
he has also been the object of a great deal.
Who has been the aggressor, it would be
difficult to determine; but it must be confessed,
that where he has not been irritated
as a writer, he appears a good-humoured
man; and, in particular instances, displays
a true philanthropy.—The whole of his
conduct respecting the Calas family;—his
protection of the Sirvens, his patronage
of the young lady descended from Corneille,
and many examples, which might
be mentioned, are all of this nature.</p>

<p>Some people will tell you, that all the
bustle he made, on these, and similar occasions,
proceeded from vanity; but in my
mind, the man who takes pains to justify
oppressed innocence, to rouse the indignation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
of mankind against cruelty, and to relieve
indigent merit, is in reality benevolent,
however vain he may be of such
actions.—Such a man is unquestionably
a more useful member of society, than the
humblest monk, who has no other plan in
life, than the working out his own salvation
in a corner.</p>

<p>Voltaire’s criticisms on the writings of
Shakespear do him no honour; they betray
an ignorance of the author, whose
works he so rashly condemns. Shakespear’s
irregularities, and his disregard for the unities
of the drama, are obvious to the dullest
of modern critics; but Voltaire’s national
prejudices, and his imperfect knowledge
of the language, render him blind to some
of the most shining beauties of the English
Poet; his remarks, however, though not
always candid nor delicate, are for the most
part lively.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>One evening, at Ferney, the conversation
happening to turn on the genius of
Shakespear, Voltaire expatiated on the
impropriety and absurdity of introducing
low characters and vulgar dialogue into
Tragedy; and gave many instances of the
English bard’s having offended in that particular,
even in his most pathetic plays. A
gentleman of the company, who is a great
admirer of Shakespear, observed, by way
of palliation, that though those characters
were low, yet they were natural (dans
la nature, was his expression). Avec permission,
Monsieur, replied Voltaire, mon
cul est bien dans la nature, et cependant je
porte des coulottes.</p>

<p>Voltaire had formerly a little theatre at
his own house, where dramatic pieces were
represented by some of the society who
visited there, he himself generally taking
some important character; but by all accounts
this was not his fort, nature having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
fitted him for conceiving the sentiments,
but not representing the actions of a
hero.</p>

<p>Mr. Cramer of Geneva sometimes assisted
upon these occasions.—I have often seen
that gentleman act at a private theatre in
that city with deserved applause. Very
few of those who have made acting the
study and business of their lives, could have
represented the characters in which he
appeared, with more judgment and
energy.</p>

<p>The celebrated Clairon herself has been
proud to tread Voltaire’s domestic theatre,
and to display at once his genius and her
own.</p>

<p>These dramatic entertainments at Ferney,
to which many of the inhabitants of
Geneva were, from time to time, invited,
in all probability increased their desire for
such amusements, and gave the hint to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
company of French comedians, to come
every summer to the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>As the Syndics and Council did not
judge it proper to license their acting, this
company have erected a theatre at Chatelaine,
which is on the French side of the
ideal line which separates that kingdom from
the territories of the Republic, and about
three miles from the ramparts of Geneva.</p>

<p>People come occasionally from Savoy
and Switzerland to attend these representations;
but the company on which the
actors chiefly depend, are the citizens of
Geneva. The play begins at three or four
in the afternoon, that the spectators may
have time to return before the shutting of
the gates.</p>

<p>I have been frequently at this theatre.
The performers are moderately good. The
admired Le Kain, who is now at Ferney,
on a visit to Voltaire, sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
exhibits:—but when I go, my chief inducement
is to see Voltaire, who generally
attends when Le Kain acts, and when
one of his own tragedies is to be represented.</p>

<p>He sits on the stage, and behind the
scenes; but so as to be seen by a great part
of the audience. He takes as much interest
in the representation, as if his own
character depended on the performance.
He seems perfectly chagrined and disgusted
when any of the actors commit a mistake;
and when he thinks they perform well,
never fails to mark his approbation with all
the violence of voice and gesture.</p>

<p>He enters into the feigned distresses of
the piece with every symptom of real
emotion, and even sheds tears with the
profusion of a girl present for the first time
at a tragedy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p>I have sometimes sat near him during
the whole entertainment, observing with
astonishment such a degree of sensibility in
a man of eighty. This great age, one
would naturally believe, might have considerably
blunted every sensation, particularly
those occasioned by the fictitious distresses
of the drama, to which he has been
habituated from his youth.</p>

<p>The pieces represented having been
written by himself, is another circumstance
which, in my opinion, should naturally
tend to prevent their effect on him. Some
people indeed assert that this, so far from
diminishing, is the real cause of all his
sensibility; and they urge, as a proof of
this assertion that he attends the theatre
only when some of his own pieces are to
be acted.</p>

<p>That he should be better pleased to see
his own tragedies represented than any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
others, is natural; but I do not readily comprehend,
how he can be more easily moved
and deceived, by distresses which he himself
invented. Yet this degree of deception
seems necessary to make a man shed
tears. While these tears are flowing, he
must believe the woes he weeps are real:
he must have been so far deceived by the
cunning of the scene, as to have forgot that
he was in a playhouse. The moment he
recollects that the whole is fiction, his sympathy
and tears must cease.</p>

<p>I should be glad, however, to see Voltaire
present at the representation of some
of Corneille or Racine’s tragedies, that I
might observe whether he would discover
more or less sensibility than he has done at
his own. We should then be able to
ascertain this curious, disputed point, whether
his sympathy regarded the piece or the
author.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>Happy, if this extraordinary man had
confined his genius to its native home, to
the walks which the muses love, and where
he has always been received with distinguished
honour, and that he had never deviated
from these, into the thorny paths of
controversy! For while he attacked the tyrants
and oppressors of mankind, and those
who have perverted the benevolent nature
of Christianity to the most selfish and malignant
purposes, it is for ever to be regretted,
that he allowed the shafts of his ridicule
to glance upon the Christian religion
itself.</p>

<p>By persevering in this, he has not only
shocked the pious, but even disgusted infidels,
who accuse him of borrowing from
himself, and repeating the same argument
in various publications; and seem as tired
of the stale sneer against the Christian doctrines,
as of the dullest and most tedious
sermons in support of them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>Voltaire’s behaviour during sickness has
been represented in very opposite lights, I
have heard much of his great contrition
and repentance, when he had reason to believe
his end approaching. These stories,
had they been true, would have proved,
that his infidelity was affectation, and that
he was a believer and Christian in his heart.</p>

<p>I own I could never give any credit to
such reports; for though I have frequently
met with vain young men, who have given
themselves airs of free-thinking, while in
reality they were even superstitious, yet I
never could understand what a man like
Voltaire, or any man of common understanding,
could propose to himself by such
absurd affectation. To pretend to despise
what we really revere, and to treat as human,
what we believe to be divine, is certainly,
of all kinds of hypocrisy, the most
unpardonable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>

<p>I was at some pains to ascertain this matter;
and I have been assured, by those who
have lived during many years in familiarity
with him, that all these stories are without
foundation. They declared, that although
he was unwilling to quit the enjoyment
of life, and used the means of preserving
health, he seemed no way afraid of the
consequences of dying. That he never discovered,
either in health or sickness, any
remorse for the works imputed to him
against the Christian religion.—That, on
the contrary, he was blinded to such a degree,
as to express uneasiness at the thoughts
of dying before some of them, in which he
was at that time engaged, were finished.</p>

<p>Though this conduct is not to be justified
upon any supposition, yet there is more consistency,
and, in my opinion, less wickedness
in it, if we admit the account which
his friends give, than there would be in his
writing at once against the established opinions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
of mankind, the conviction of his
own conscience, and the inspirations of the
Deity, merely to acquire the applause of a
few mistaken infidels.</p>

<p>However erroneous he may have been,
I cannot suspect him of such absurdity.
On the contrary, I imagine, that as soon as
he is convinced of the truths of Christianity,
he will openly avow his opinion, in health
as in sickness, uniformly, to his last moment.</p>

<h2 id="LETTER_XXXI">LETTER XXXI.</h2>

<p class="right">Geneva.</p>

<p>In obedience to your request, I shall give
you my opinion freely with regard to
Lord ——’s scheme of sending his two
sons to be educated at Geneva.</p>

<p>The eldest, if I remember right, is not
more than nine years of age; and they have
advanced no farther in their education than
being able to read English tolerably well.
His Lordship’s idea is, that when they shall
have acquired a perfect knowledge of the
French language, they may be taught Latin
through the medium of that language, and
pursue any other study that may be thought
proper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>I have attended to his Lordship’s objections
against the public schools in England,
and after due consideration, and weighing
every circumstance, I remain of opinion,
that no country but Great Britain is proper
for the education of a British subject, who
proposes to pass his life in his own country.
The most important point, in my mind, to
be secured in the education of a young man
of rank of our country, is to make him an
Englishman; and this can be done nowhere
so effectually as in England.</p>

<p>He will there acquire those sentiments,
that particular taste and turn of mind,
which will make him prefer the government,
and relish the manners, the diversions,
and general way of living, which
prevail in England.</p>

<p>He will there acquire that character,
which distinguishes Englishmen from the
natives of all the other countries of Europe,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
and which once attained, however it may
be afterwards embellished or deformed, can
never be entirely effaced.</p>

<p>If it could be proved, that this character
is not the most amiable, it does not follow
that it is not the most expedient. It is
sufficient, that it is upon the whole most
approved of in England. For I hold it as
indisputable, that the good opinion of a
man’s countrymen is of more importance
to him than that of all the rest of mankind:
Indeed, without the first, he very
rarely can enjoy the second.</p>

<p>It is thought, that, by an early foreign
education, all ridiculous English prejudices
will be avoided. This may be true;—but
other prejudices, perhaps as ridiculous, and
much more detrimental, will be formed.
The first cannot be attended with many inconveniencies;
the second may render the
young people unhappy in their own country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
when they return, and disagreeable to
their countrymen all the rest of their lives.</p>

<p>It is true, that the French manners are
adopted in almost every country of Europe:
they prevail all over Germany and the
northern courts. They are gaining ground,
though with a slower pace, in Spain, and in
the Italian states.—This is not the case in
England.—The English manners are universal
in the provinces, prevail in the capital,
and are to be found uncontaminated
even at court.</p>

<p>In all the countries above mentioned, the
body of the people behold this preference
to foreign manners with disgust. But in
all those countries, the sentiments of the
people are disregarded; whereas, in England,
popularity is of real importance; and
the higher a man’s rank is, the more he will
feel the loss of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span></p>

<p>Besides, a prejudice against French manners
is not confined to the lower ranks in
England:—It is diffused over the whole
nation. Even those who have none of the
usual prejudices;—who do all manner of
justice to the talents and ingenuity of their
neighbours;—who approve of French manners
in French people; yet cannot suffer
them when grafted on their countrymen.
Should an English gentleman think this
kind of grafting at all admissible, it will be
in some of the lowest classes with whom he
is connected, as his tailor, barber, valet-de-chambre,
or cook;—but never in his
friend.</p>

<p>I can scarcely remember an instance of
an Englishman of fashion, who has evinced
in his dress or style of living a preference
to French manners, who did not lose by it
in the opinion of his countrymen.</p>

<p>What I have said of French manners is
applicable to foreign manners in general,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
which are all in some degree French, and
the particular differences are not distinguished
by the English.</p>

<p>The sentiments of the citizens of Geneva
are more analogous in many respects to the
turn of thinking in England, than to the
general opinions in France. Yet a Genevois
in London will universally pass for a
Frenchman.</p>

<p>An English boy, sent to Geneva at an
early period of life, and remaining there
six or seven years, if his parents be not
along with him, will probably, in the eyes
of the English, appear a kind of Frenchman
all his life after. This is an inconvenience
which ought to be avoided with the
greatest attention.</p>

<p>With regard to the objections against
public schools, they are in many respects
applicable to those of every country. But
I freely own, they never appeared to me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
sufficient to overbalance the advantages
which attend that method of education;
particularly as it is conducted in English
public schools.</p>

<p>I have perceived a certain hardihood and
manliness of character in boys who have
had a public education, superior to what
appears in those of the same age educated
privately.</p>

<p>At a public school, though a general attention
is paid to the whole, in many particulars
each boy is necessitated to decide
and act for himself. His reputation among
his companions depends solely on his own
conduct. This gradually strengthens the
mind, inspires firmness and decision, and
prevents that wavering imbecility observable
in those who have been long accustomed to
rely upon the assistance and opinion of
others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<p>The original impressions which sink into
the heart and mind, and form the character,
never change.—The objects of our attention
vary in the different periods of life.—This
is sometimes mistaken for a change
of character, which in reality remains essentially
the same.—He who is reserved,
deceitful, cruel, or avaricious, when a boy,
will not, in any future period of life, become
open, faithful, compassionate, or
generous.</p>

<p>The young mind has, at a public school,
the best chance of receiving those sentiments
which incline the heart to friendship,
and correct selfishness. They are
drawn in by observation, which is infinitely
more powerful than precept.</p>

<p>A boy perceives, that courage, generosity,
gratitude, command the esteem and
applause of all his companions. He cherishes
these qualities in his own breast, and
endeavours to connect himself in friendship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
with those who possess them.—He sees that
meanness of spirit, ingratitude, and perfidy,
are the objects of detestation.—He
shuns the boys who display any indications
of these odious qualities. What is the object
of applause or contempt to his school-fellows,
he will endeavour to graft into, or
eradicate from, his own character, with ten
thousand times more eagerness than that
which was applauded and censured by his
tutor or parents.</p>

<p>The admonitions of these last have probably
lost their effect by frequent repetition;
or he may imagine their maxims are
only applicable to a former age, and to
manners which are obsolete.—But he feels
the sentiments of his companions affect his
reputation and fame in the most sensible
manner.</p>

<p>In all the countries of Europe, England
excepted, such a deference is paid to boys
of rank at the public schools, that emulation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
the chief spur to diligence, is greatly
blunted.—The boys in the middle rank of
life are depressed by the insolence of their
titled companions, which they are not allowed
to correct or retaliate.—This has
the worst effect on the minds of both, by
rendering these more insolent, and those
more abject.</p>

<p>The public schools in England disdain
this mean partiality; and are, on that account,
peculiarly useful to boys of high
rank and great fortune. These young people
are exceedingly apt to imbibe false ideas of
their own importance, which in those impartial
seminaries will be perfectly ascertained,
and the real merit of the youths
weighed in juster scales than are generally
to be found in a parent’s house.</p>

<p>The young peer will be taught by the
matters, and still more effectually by his
comrades, this most useful of all lessons,—to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
expect distinction and esteem from personal
qualities only; because no other can
make him estimable, or even save him from
contempt.—He will see a dunce of high
rank flogged with as little ceremony as the
son of a tailor; and the richest coward
kicked about by his companions equally
with the poorest poltroon.—He will find
that diligence, genius, and spirit, are the
true sources of superiority and applause,
both within and without the school.</p>

<p>The active principle of emulation, when
allowed full play, as in the chief schools in
England, operates in various ways, and always
with a good effect.—If a boy finds
that he falls beneath his companions in
literary merit, he will endeavour to excel
them in intrepidity, or some other accomplishment.—If
he be brought to disgrace
for neglecting his exercise, he will try to
save himself from contempt by the firmness
with which he bears his punishment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p>

<p>The listlessness and indolence to be found
so frequently among our young people of
rank, are not to be imputed to their education
at a public school, which in reality
has the greatest tendency to counteract
these habits, and often does so, and gives an
energy to the mind which remains through
life.</p>

<p>Those wretched qualities creep on afterwards,
when the youths become their own
masters, and have enfeebled their minds
by indulging in all the pleasures which
fortune puts in their power, and luxury
presents.</p>

<p>Upon the whole, I am clearly of opinion,
that the earliest period of every Englishman’s
education, during which the mind
receives the most lasting impressions, ought
to be in England.</p>

<p>If, however, the opinion of relations, or
any peculiarity in situation, prevents his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
being educated at home, Geneva should be
preferred to any other place. Or if, by
some neglect, either of his own or his
parents, a young English gentleman of fortune
has allowed the first years of youth
to fly unimproved, and has attained the age
of seventeen or eighteen with little literary
knowledge, I know no place where he may
have a better chance of recovering what he
has lost than in this city. He may have a
choice of men of eminence, in every branch
of literature, to assist him in his studies, a
great proportion of whom are men of genius,
and as amiable in their manners as
they are eminent in their particular professions.</p>

<p>He will have constant opportunities of
being in company with very ingenious
people, whose thoughts and conversation
turn upon literary subjects. In such society,
a young man will feel the necessity of
some degree of study. This will gradually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
form a taste for knowledge, which may remain
through life.</p>

<p>It may also be numbered among the advantages
of this place, that there are few
objects of dissipation, and hardly any
sources of amusement, besides those derived
from the natural beauties of the country,
and from an intimacy with a people by
whose conversation a young man can scarce
fail to improve.</p>

<p><i>P. S.</i> An English nobleman and his lady
having taken the resolution of educating
their son at Geneva, attended him hither,
and have effectually prevented the inconveniencies
above mentioned, by remaining
with him for seven or eight years.</p>

<p>The hospitality, generosity, and benevolent
dispositions of this family had acquired
them the highest degree of popularity. I
saw them leave the place. Their carriage
could with difficulty move through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
multitude, who were assembled in the
streets.—Numbers of the poorer sort,
who had been relieved by their secret charity,
unable longer to obey the injunctions
of their benefactors, proclaimed their gratitude
aloud.</p>

<p>The young gentleman was obliged to
come out again and again to his old friends
and companions, who pressed around the
coach to bid him farewel, and express their
sorrow for his departure, and their wishes
for his prosperity. The eyes of the parents
overflowed with tears of happiness; and the
whole family carried along with them the
affections of the greater part, and the esteem
of all the citizens.</p>

<h2 id="LETTER_XXXII">LETTER XXXII.</h2>

<p class="right">Geneva.</p>

<p>Suicide is very frequent at Geneva. I
am told this has been the case ever since
the oldest people in the republic can remember;
and there is reason to believe,
that it happens oftener here, in proportion
to the number of inhabitants, than in England,
or any other country of Europe.</p>

<p>The multiplicity of instances which has
occurred since I have been here is astonishing.
Two that have happened very lately
are remarkable for the peculiar circumstances
which accompanied them.</p>

<p>The first was occasioned by a sudden and
unaccountable fit of despair, which seized
the son of one of the wealthiest and most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
respectable citizens of the republic. This
young gentleman had, in appearance, every
reason to be satisfied with his lot. He was
handsome, and in the vigour of youths
married to a woman of an excellent character,
who had brought him a great fortune,
and by whom he was the father of a
fine child. In the midst of all these blessings,
surrounded by every thing which could inspire
a man with an attachment to life,
he felt it insupportable, and without any
obvious cause of chagrin, determined to
destroy himself.</p>

<p>Having passed some hours with his mother,
a most valuable woman, and with his
wife and child, he left them in apparent
good humour, went into another room, applied
the muzzle of a musket to his forehead,
thrust back the trigger with his toe,
and blew out his brains, in the hearing of
the unsuspecting company he had just
quitted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<p>The second instance, is that of a blacksmith,
who, taking the same fatal resolution,
and not having any convenient instrument
at hand, charged an old gun-barrel
with a brace of bullets, and putting one
end into the fire of his forge, tied a string
to the handle of the bellows, by pulling of
which he could make them play, while he
was at a convenient distance. Kneeling
down, he then placed his head near the
mouth of the barrel, and moving the bellows
by means of the string, they blew up
the fire, he keeping his head with astonishing
firmness, and horrible deliberation, in
that position, till the farther end of the
barrel was so heated as to kindle the powder,
whose explosion instantly drove the
bullets through his brains.</p>

<p>Though I know that this happened literally
as I have related, yet there is
something so extraordinary, and almost incredible,
in the circumstances, that perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
I should not have mentioned it, had it not
been well attested, and known to the inhabitants
of Geneva, and all the English who
are at present here.</p>

<p>Why suicide is more frequent in Great
Britain and Geneva than elsewhere, would
be a matter of curious investigation. For it
appears very extraordinary, that men should
be most inclined to kill themselves in countries
where the blessings of life are best
secured. There must be some strong and
peculiar cause for an effect so preposterous.</p>

<p>Before coming here, I was of opinion,
that the frequency of suicide in England
was occasioned in a great measure by the
stormy and unequal climate, which, while
it clouds the sky, throws also a gloom over
the minds of the natives.—To this cause,
foreigners generally add, that of the use of
coal, instead of wood, for fuel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span></p>

<p>I rested satisfied with some vague theory,
built on these taken together:—But neither
can account for the same effect at Geneva,
where coal is not used, and where
the climate is the same with that in Switzerland,
Savoy, and the neighbouring parts
of France, where instances of suicide are
certainly much more rare.</p>

<p>Without presuming to decide what are
the remote causes of this fatal propensity,
it appears evident to me, that no reasoning
can have the smallest force in preventing
it, but what is founded upon the soul’s immortality
and a future state.—What effect
can the common arguments have on a man
who does not believe that necessary and important
doctrine?—He may be told, that
he did not give himself life, therefore he
has no right to take it away;—that he is a
centinel on a post, and ought to remain till
he is relieved;—what is all this to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
man who thinks he is never to be questioned
for his violence and desertion?</p>

<p>If you attempt to pique this man’s pride,
by asserting, that it is a greater proof of
courage to bear the ills of life, than to flee
from them; he will answer you from the
Roman history, and ask, Whether Cato,
Cassius, and Marcus Brutus, were cowards?</p>

<p>The great legislator of the Jews seems
to have been convinced, that no law or
argument against suicide could have any
influence on the minds of people who were
ignorant of the soul’s immortality; and
therefore, as he did not think it necessary
to instruct them in the one (for reasons
which the Bishop of Gloucester has unfolded
in his treatise on the Divine Legation
of Moses), he also thought it superfluous
to give them any express law against the
other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>

<p>Those philosophers, therefore, who have
endeavoured to shake this great and important
conviction from the minds of men,
have thereby opened a door to suicide as
well as to other crimes.—For, whoever reasons
against that, without founding upon
the doctrine of a future state, will soon see
all his arguments overturned.</p>

<p>It must be acknowledged, indeed, that
in many cases this question is decided by
men’s feelings, independent of reasonings
of any kind.</p>

<p>Nature has not trusted a matter of so
great importance entirely to the fallible
reason of man; but has planted in the
human breast such a love of life, and horror
of death, as seldom can be overcome even
by the greatest misfortunes.</p>

<p>But there is a disease which sometimes
affects the body, and afterwards communicates
its baneful influence to the mind, over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
which it hangs such a cloud of horrors as
renders life absolutely insupportable. In
this dreadful state, every pleasing idea is
banished, and all the sources of comfort
in life are poisoned.—Neither fortune,
honours, friends, nor family, can afford the
smallest satisfaction.—Hope, the last pillar
of the wretched, falls to the ground—Despair
lays hold of the abandoned sufferer—Then
all reasoning becomes vain—Even
arguments of religion have no weight,
and the poor creature embraces death as
his only friend, which, as he thinks, may
terminate, but cannot augment, his misery.</p>

<p>The D—— of H—— having a desire
to visit some of the German Courts,
we bade adieu to our friends at Geneva,
and are thus far on our intended journey.
It is of peculiar advantage in Germany,
above all other countries, to be in company
with a man of rank and high title, because
it facilitates your reception every where,
and supersedes the necessity of recommendatory
letters.</p>

<p>I have met here with my friend B——n,
whose company and conversation have retarded
our journey, by supplying the chief
objects of travelling, if amusement and instruction
are to be ranked among them. He is here with
the M——s of L——y,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
a lively, spirited young man;—one of those
easy, careless characters, so much beloved
by their intimates, and so regardless of the
opinion of the rest of mankind.</p>

<p>Since you hold me to my promise of
writing so very regularly, you must sometimes
expect to receive a letter dated from
three or four different places, when either
my short stay in one place deprives me of
the leisure, or meeting with nothing uncommon
in another deprives me of materials
for so long a letter as you require.</p>

<p>The road from Geneva to this town is
along the side of the lake, through a delightful
country, abounding in vineyards,
which produce the <i>vin de la côte</i>, so much
esteemed. All the little towns on the way,
Nyon, Rolle, and Morges, are finely situated,
neatly built, and inhabited by a thriving
and contented people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span></p>

<p>Lausanne is the capital of this charming
country, which formerly belonged to
the Duke of Savoy, but is now under the
dominion of the canton of Bern.</p>

<p>However mortifying this may be to the
former possessor, it has certainly been a
happy dispensation to the inhabitants of the
Pays de Vaud, who are in every respect
more at their ease, and in a better situation,
than any of the subjects of his Sardinian
Majesty.</p>

<p>This city is situated near the lake, and
at the distance of about thirty miles from
Geneva. As the nobility, from the country,
and from some parts of Switzerland,
and the families of several officers, who
have retired from service, reside here, there
is an air of more ease and gaiety (perhaps
also more politeness) in the societies at
Lausanne, than in those of Geneva; at least
this is firmly believed and asserted by all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
the nobles of this place, who consider
themselves as greatly superior to the citizens
of Geneva. These, on the other
hand, talk a good deal of the poverty, frivolousness,
and ignorance of those same
nobility, and make no scruple of ranking
their own enlightened mechanics above
them in every essential quality.</p>

<p class="right">Vevay.</p>

<p>The road between Lausanne and Vevay
is very mountainous; but the mountains are
cultivated to the summits, and covered with
vines.—This would have been impracticable
on account of the steepness, had not
the proprietors built strong stone-walls at
proper intervals, one above the other,
which support the soil, and form little
terraces from the bottom to the top of the
mountains.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span></p>

<p>The peasants ascend by narrow stairs,
and, before they arrive at the ground they
are to cultivate, have frequently to mount
higher than a mason who is employed in
repairing the top of a steeple.</p>

<p>The mountainous nature of this country
subjects it to frequent torrents, which,
when violent, sweep away vines, soil, and
walls in one common destruction. The
inhabitants behold the havoc with a steady
concern, and, without giving way to the
clamorous rage of the French, or sinking
into the gloomy despair of the English,
think only of the most effectual means of
repairing the loss.—As soon as the storm
has abated, they begin, with admirable patience
and perseverance, to rebuild the
walls, to carry fresh earth on hurdles to the
top of the mountain, and to spread a new
soil wherever the old has been washed
away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span></p>

<p>Where property is perfectly secure,
and men allowed to enjoy the fruits of
their own labour, they are capable of
efforts unknown in those countries where
despotism renders every thing precarious,
and where a tyrant reaps what slaves have
sown.</p>

<p>This part of the Pays de Vaud is inhabited
by the descendents of those unhappy
people, who were driven by the most absurd
and cruel persecution from the vallies
of Piedmont and Savoy.</p>

<p>I will not assert, that the iniquity of the
persecutors has been visited upon their
children; but the sufferings and stedfastness
of the persecuted seem to be recompensed
by the happy situation in which
their children of the third and fourth generations
are now placed.</p>

<p>Vevay is a pretty little town, containing
between three and four thousand inhabitants.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
It is sweetly situated on a plain,
near the head of the lake of Geneva, where
the Rhone enters. The mountains behind
the town, though exceedingly high, are
entirely cultivated, like those on the road
from Lausanne.</p>

<p>There is a large village about half-way
up the mountain, in a direct line above
Vevay, which, viewed from below, seems
adhering to the side of the precipice, and
has a very singular and romantic appearance.</p>

<p>The principal church is detached from
the town, and situated on a hill which
overlooks it. From the terrace, or church-yard,
there is a view of the Alps, the
Rhone, the lake, with towns and villages
on its margin.—Within this church the
body of General Ludlow is deposited. That
steady republican withdrew from Lausanne
to this place, after the assassination of his
friend Lisle, who was shot through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
heart, as he was going to church, by a
ruffian, who had come across the lake for
that purpose, and who, amidst the confusion
occasioned by the murder, got safe to
the boat, and escaped to the Duke of Savoy’s
territories on the other side, where he was
openly protected.—This was a pitiful way
of avenging the death of a monarch, who,
whether justly or not, had been publicly
condemned and executed.</p>

<p>There is a long Latin epitaph on Ludlow’s
monument, enumerating many circumstances
of his life, but omitting the
most remarkable of them all. He is called,
Patriæ libertatis defensor, et potestatis arbitrariæ
propugnator acerrimus, &amp;c.—But no
nearer hint is given of his having been one
of King Charles the First’s judges, and of
his having signed the sentence against that
ill-fated Prince.</p>

<p>However fond the Swiss in general may
be of liberty, and however partial to its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
assertors, it is presumable that those who
protected Ludlow, did not approve of this
part of his story, and on that account a
particular mention of it was not made on
his tomb.</p>

<p>There is no travelling by post through
Switzerland; we therefore hired horses at
Geneva, to carry us to Basil; from whence
we can proceed by post to Strasbourg,
which is the route we design to take. We
leave Lausanne the day after to-morrow.</p>

<p>On my return from Vevay to Lausanne,
I found our friend, Mr. H——y, at
the inn, with the D—— of H——. His Grace
inclines to remain some time longer at that
city; but desired that I might proceed with
the carriages and all the servants, except
his valet-de-chambre and one footman, to
Strasbourg, which I readily agreed to, on
his promising to join me there within a
few days. H——y, at the same time, made
the very agreeable proposal of accompanying
me to Strasbourg, where he will remain
till our departure from thence, leaving his
chaise for the D——.</p>

<p>We began our journey the following
day, and were escorted as far as Payerne by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
Messrs. B——n and O——n, where we
passed a gay evening, and proceeded next
morning to the town of Avanche, the capital
of Switzerland in Tacitus’s time<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>.</p>

<p>No country in the world can be more
agreeable to travellers during the summer
than Switzerland: For, besides the commodious
roads and comfortable inns, some
of the most beautiful objects of nature,
woods, mountains, lakes, intermingled with
fertile fields, vineyards, and scenes of the
most perfect cultivation, are here presented
to the eye in greater variety, and on a larger
scale, than in any other country.</p>

<p>From Avanche we advanced to Murten,
or Murat, as it is pronounced by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
French, a neat little town, situated upon a
rising ground, on the side of the lake of the
same name.</p>

<p>The army of Charles Duke of Burgundy,
besieging this town, was defeated, with
great slaughter, by the Swiss, in the year
1476. Near the road, within a mile of
Murat, there is a little building full of human
bones, which are said to be those of
the Burgundians slain in that battle. As
this curious cabinet was erected many years
after the battle, it may be supposed, that
some of the bones of the victors are here
packed up along with those of the vanquished,
in order to swell the collection.</p>

<p>There are several inscriptions on the
chapel.</p>

<p class="center">DEO OPTIM. MAX.<br />

<p>The borders of the lake of Murat are
enriched with gentlemen’s houses, and villages
in great abundance.</p>

<p>The dress, manners, and persons of the
inhabitants of this country indicate a different
people from the Genevois, Savoyards,
or the inhabitants of the Pays de Vaud.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span></p>

<p>We dined at Murat, and remained several
hours in the town. There was a fair,
and a great concourse of people.—The
Swiss peasants are the tallest and most robust
I have ever seen. Their dress is very
particular.—They have little round hats,
like those worn by the Dutch skippers.—Their
coats and waistcoats are all of a kind
of coarse black cloth.—Their breeches are
made of coarse linen, something like sailors
trowsers; but drawn together in plaits below
the knees, and the stockings are of the
same stuff with the breeches.</p>

<p>The women wear short jackets, with a
great superfluity of buttons. The unmarried
women value themselves on the length
of their hair, which they separate into two
divisions, and allow to hang at its full
length, braided with ribands in the Ramillie
fashion.—After marriage, these
tresses are no longer permitted to hang<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
down; but, being twisted round the head
in spiral lines, are fixed at the crown with
large silver pins. This is the only difference
in point of dress which matrimony
makes.</p>

<p>Married and unmarried wear straw hats,
ornamented with black ribands. So far
the women’s dress is becoming enough;
but they have an aukward manner of fixing
their petticoats so high as to leave
hardly any waist. This encroachment of
the petticoats upon the waist, with the
amazing number they wear, gives a size
and importance to the lower and hind part
of the body to which it is by no means entitled,
and mightily deforms the appearance
of the whole person.</p>

<p>The elegant figure of the Venus de
Medicis, or of the D——ss of D——re,
would be impaired, or annihilated, under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
such a preposterous load of dress.—As
we arrived only this afternoon, I can say
nothing of Bern. You shall hear more in
my next. Meanwhile, I am, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Bern is a regular well-built town, with
some air of magnificence. The houses
are of a fine white free-stone, and pretty
uniform, particularly in the principal street,
where they are all exactly of the same
height. There are piazzas on each side,
with a walk, raised four feet above the level
of the street, very commodious in wet
weather.</p>

<p>A small branch of the Aar has been
turned into this street, and being confined
to a narrow channel in the middle, which
has a considerable slope, it runs with great
rapidity; and, without being a disagreeable
object of itself, is of great service in keeping
the street clean.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span></p>

<p>Another circumstance contributes to render
this one of the most cleanly towns
in Europe:—Criminals are employed in removing
rubbish from the streets and public
walks. The more atrocious delinquents
are chained to waggons, while those who
are condemned for smaller crimes, are employed
in sweeping the light rubbish into
the rivulet, and throwing the heavier into
the carts or waggons, which their more
criminal companions are obliged to push or
draw along.</p>

<p>These wretches have collars of iron fixed
around their necks, with a projecting handle
in the form of a hook to each, by which,
on the slightest offence or mutiny, they
may be seized, and are entirely at the command
of the guard, whose duty it is to see
them perform their work.—People of both
sexes are condemned to this labour for
months, years, or for life, according to the
nature of their crimes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span></p>

<p>It is alleged, that over and above the deterring
from crimes, which is effected by
this, in common with the other methods
of punishing, there is the additional advantage,
of obliging the criminal to repair by
his labour the injury which he has done to
the community.</p>

<p>I suspect, however, that this advantage
is overbalanced by the bad effects of habituating
people to behold the misery of their
fellow-creatures, which I imagine gradually
hardens the hearts of the spectators,
and renders them less susceptible of the
emotions of compassion and pity;—feelings,
which, perhaps of all others, have the
best influence upon, and are the most becoming,
human nature. Juvenal says,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span></p>

<p>Wherever public executions and punishments
are frequent, the common people
have been observed to acquire a greater degree
of insensibility, and cruelty of disposition,
than in places where such scenes seldom
occur.—I remember, while I was at
Geneva, where executions are very rare, a
young man was condemned to be hanged
for murder, and there was a general
gloom and uneasiness evident in every society
for several days before and after the
execution.</p>

<p>The public buildings at Bern, as the hospital,
the granary, the guard-house, the
arsenal, and the churches, are magnificent.
There is a very elegant building just completed,
with accommodations for many
public amusements, such as balls, concerts,
and theatrical entertainments. There are
also apartments for private societies and assemblies.
It was built by a voluntary subscription
among the nobility; and no societies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
but of the patrician order, are allowed
there.</p>

<p>Theatrical entertainments are seldom
permitted at Bern; none have as yet been
performed at this new theatre.</p>

<p>The walk by the great church was formerly
the only public walk, and much admired
on account of the view from it, and
the peculiarity of its situation, being on a
level with the streets on one side, and some
hundred feet of perpendicular height above
them on the other. But there is now another
public walk, at some distance without
the town, which has been lately made upon
a high bank by the side of the Aar, and is
the most magnificent I ever saw belonging
to this or any other town. From it there is
a commanding view of the river, the town
of Bern, the country about it, and the Glaciers
of Switzerland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span></p>

<p>I have visited the library, where, besides
the books, there are a few antiques, and
some other curiosities. The small figure of
the priest pouring wine between the horns
of a bull, is valuable only because it illustrates
a passage in Virgil, and has been
mentioned by Addison.</p>

<p>An addition was lately made to this library
by a collection of English books,
magnificently bound, which were sent as a
present by an English gentleman; who,
though he has thought proper to conceal
his name, has sufficiently discovered his
political principles by the nature of the
collection, amongst which, I distinguished
Milton’s works, particularly his prose writings;
Algernon Sidney on Government,
Locke, Ludlow’s Memoirs, Gordon’s translation
of Tacitus, Addison’s works, particularly
The Freeholder; Marvel’s works,
Steel’s, &amp;c. They were the largest and
finest editions, and might be about the value<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
of 200l.—This gentleman made a present
of the same nature to the public library
at Geneva.</p>

<p>I happened to open the Glasgow edition
of Homer, which I saw here, on a
blank page of which was an address in
Latin to the Corsican General, Paoli, signed
James Boswell. This very elegant book
had been sent, I suppose, as a present from
Mr. Boswell to his friend the General; and,
when that unfortunate chief was obliged to
abandon his country, fell, with other of
his effects, into the hands of the Swiss
officer in the French service, who made a
present of the Homer to this library.</p>

<p>The arsenal I could not have omitted seeing
had I been so inclined, as the Bernois
value themselves on the trophies contained
in it, and upon the quantity, good condition,
and arrangement of the arms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span></p>

<p>Nothing interested me so much as the
figures of the brave Switzers, who first took
arms against tyranny, and that of William
Tell, who is represented aiming at the
apple on his son’s head. I contemplated
this with an emotion which was created
by the circumstances of the story, not by
the workmanship; for, at that moment, I
should have beheld with neglect the most
exquisite statue that ever was formed of
Augustus Cæsar.</p>

<p>Surely no characters have so just a claim
to the admiration and gratitude of posterity,
as those who have freed their countrymen
from the capricious insolence of tyrants:
And whether all the incidents of Tell’s
story be true or fabulous, the men (whoever
they were) who roused and incited
their fellow-citizens to throw off the Austrian
yoke, deserve to be regarded as patriots,
having undoubtedly been actuated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
by that principle, so dear to every generous
heart, the spirit of independence,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>Mr. Addison observes, that there is no
great pleasure in visiting arsenals, merely to
see a repetition of these magazines of war;
yet it is worth while, as it gives an idea of
the force of a state, and serves to fix in the
mind the most considerable parts of its
history.</p>

<p>The arms taken from the Burgundians,
in the various battles which established the
liberty of Switzerland, are displayed here;
also the figure of the General of Bern, who,
in the year 1536, conquered the Pays de
Vaud from Charles III. Duke of Savoy:—And,
if they have no trophies to shew of a
later date, I am convinced it is because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
they are too poor and too wise to aim at
any extension of dominion:—And because
all the neighbouring powers are at length
become sensible, that the nature of their
country, and their personal valour, have
rendered the Swiss as unconquerable, as,
from political considerations, they are averse
to attempt conquests.</p>

<h2 id="LETTER_XXXVI">LETTER XXXVI.</h2>

<p class="right">Bern.</p>

<p>The different cantons of Switzerland,
though united together by a common
bond, and all of a republican form of government,
differ in the nature of that
form, as well as in religion.</p>

<p>The Roman Catholic religion being favourable
to monarchy, one would naturally
imagine, that, when adopted by a republic,
it would gradually wind up the government
to the highest pitch of aristocracy.</p>

<p>The fact nevertheless is, that those cantons,
which are in the strongest degree democratical,
are of the Popish persuasion;
and the most perfect aristocracy of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
all is established in this Protestant canton of
Bern, which is also indeed the most powerful.
In extent of country, and number
of inhabitants, it is reckoned nearly equal
to all the others taken together.</p>

<p>The nobility of Bern are accused of an
extraordinary degree of pride and stateliness.
They affect to keep the citizens at
a great distance; and it is with difficulty
that their wives and daughters will condescend
to mix with the mercantile families
at balls, assemblies, and such public occasions,
where numbers seem essential to the
nature of the entertainment; by which
means a nobility ball loses in cheerfulness
what it retains in dignity, and is often, as
I am told, as devoid of amusement as it is
solemn.</p>

<p>The whole power of the government, and
all the honourable offices of the state, are
in the hands of the nobility. As it is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
permitted them to trade, they would naturally
fall into poverty without this resource:
But by the number of places which the
nobles enjoy, and to which very considerable
pensions are annexed, the poorest of
them are enabled to support their families
with dignity.</p>

<p>The bailliages, into which the whole
canton and the conquered territories are
divided, form lucrative and honourable
establishments for the principal families of
Bern. The bailiff is governor and judge
in his own district, and there is a magnificent
chateau in each for his accommodation.
An appeal may be made from all
subordinate courts to him; as also from his
decision, to the council at Bern.</p>

<p>The nobility of Bern, though born to be
judges, are not always instructed in law.
It has therefore been thought requisite, to
appoint a certain number of persons, as their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
assessors, who have been bred to the profession.
But in case the judge should differ
from those assessors, and retain his own
opinion in spite of their remonstrances, as
nobility has the precedency of law, the decision
must be given according to the will
of the judge.</p>

<p>This office remains in the hands of the
same person for the term of six years only.
I have been informed, that in some of these
bailliages, the governor may live with proper
magnificence, and lay up, during the
period of his office, two or three thousand
pounds, without extortion, or unbecoming
parsimony. There is no law against his
being afterwards named to another bailliage.</p>

<p>The executive power of the government,
with all the lucrative and honourable offices,
being thus in the hands of the nobility,
it may be imagined, that the middle
and lower ranks of people are poor and oppressed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
This, however, is by no means
the case; for the citizens, I mean the merchants
and trades-people, seem, in general,
to enjoy all the comforts and conveniencies
of life. And the peasantry is uncommonly
wealthy throughout the whole canton of
Bern.</p>

<p>The Swiss have no objection to their
nobles being their judges, and to the principal
offices of government remaining in
their hands. They look upon the nobility
as their natural superiors, and think, that
they and their families ought to be supported
with a certain degree of splendor:—But
the power of direct taxation is a different
question, and must be managed with
all possible caution and delicacy. It is a
common cause, and the conduct of the
nobles in this particular is watched with
very jealous eyes. They are sufficiently
aware of this, and use their power with
moderation. But lest the nobles should at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
any time forget, a very good hint is given
in a German inscription in the arsenal, implying,
That the insolence and rapacity of
high rank had brought about the liberty of
Switzerland.</p>

<p>A people who have always arms in their
hands, and form the only military force of
the country, are in no danger of being oppressed
and irritated with taxes.</p>

<p>It has been considered by some as a pernicious
policy in the Swiss, to allow so
many of their inhabitants to serve as mercenaries
in the different armies of Europe.
There are others, who consider this measure
as expedient, or less pernicious in the
Swiss cantons, than it would be in any other
country.</p>

<p>They who support this opinion, assert,
that every part of Switzerland, which is capable
of cultivation, is already improved to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
the highest degree; that, after retaining a
sufficient number of hands to keep it always
in this condition, and for the support
of every manufactory, still there remains
a surplus of inhabitants, which forms the
troops that are allowed to go into foreign
services. They add, that these troops only
engage for a limited number of years, after
the expiration of which, many of them return
with money to their native country;
and all of them, by stipulation, may be recalled
by the state on any emergency.—By
this means, they retain a numerous and
well-disciplined army on foot; which, so
far from being a burden, in reality enriches
the state:—an advantage which no other
people ever possessed.</p>

<p>There is still another motive for this
measure, which, though it be not openly
avowed, yet, I suspect, has considerable
weight: The council are perhaps afraid,
that if the young nobility were kept at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
home, where they could have but few objects
to occupy them, they might cabal and
spread dissentions in the state; or perhaps,
through idleness and ambition, excite dangerous
insurrections among the peasants.
For, although the laws are severe against
state crimes, and easily put in execution
against ordinary offenders, it might be difficult
and dangerous to punish a popular
young nobleman.</p>

<p>It may on these accounts be thought
highly prudent, to allow a large proportion
of them to exhaust, in some foreign service,
the fiery and restless years of youth,
which at home might have been spent in
faction and dangerous intrigues. Very
probably the states would incline to permit
the officers to go, while they retained
the private men at home; but are under a
necessity of allowing the latter also, because
without them the officers could not be
raised to those distinguished situations in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
foreign services which are their greatest inducements
to leave their own country.</p>

<p>After having served a certain time, almost
all of them return to Switzerland.
Some, because they are tired of dissipation;
others to inherit a paternal estate; and
many with pensions from the Princes they
have served.—The heat of youth is then
most probably over.—They begin to aspire
to those offices in their own country to
which their birth gives them a claim, and
which they now prefer to the lustre of military
rank. They wish to support those
laws, and that government, which they find
so partial to their families; or they desire
to pass the remainder of life in ease and retirement
on their paternal estates.</p>

<p>It is remarkable, that the Swiss officers,
who return from foreign services, particularly
that of France, instead of importing
French manners to their native mountains,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
and infecting their countrymen with the
luxuries and fopperies of that nation, throw
off all foreign airs with their uniform, and
immediately resume the plain and frugal
style of life which prevails in their own
country.</p>

<h2 id="LETTER_XXXVII">LETTER XXXVII.</h2>

<p class="right">Basil.</p>

<p>Having, on a former occasion, made a
more extensive tour through Switzerland,
we determined not to deviate from
the direct road to Strasbourg. In pursuance
of this resolution, H——y and I, when we
left Bern, passed by Soleurre, the capital of
the canton of the same name.</p>

<p>Soleurre is an agreeable little town situated
on the river Aar. The houses are
neatly built, and not inelegant; the meanest
of them have a cleanly appearance.
The common people seem to be in easier
circumstances, and have a greater air of
content, than in any Roman Catholic country
I have ever visited. The inn where we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
lodged has the comfortable look of an English
one. The French ambassador to the
cantons has his residence in this town. One
of the churches of Soleurre is the most magnificent
modern building in Switzerland.</p>

<p>The arsenal is stored with arms in proportion
to the number of inhabitants in the
canton; and there are trophies, and other
monuments of the valour of their ancestors,
as in the arsenal of Bern. In the middle
of the hall there are thirteen figures of men
in complete armour, representing the thirteen
Swiss cantons.</p>

<p>The country between Soleurre and Basil,
though very hilly, is beautiful, perhaps
the more so on that account; because of
the variety of surface and different views it
presents. H——y and I had more leisure
to admire those fine landscapes than we
wished, for the axle tree of the chaise
broke at some miles distant from Basil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span></p>

<p>It was the gay season of the vintage.—The
country was crowded with peasantry
of both sexes and every age, all employed
in gathering and carrying home the grapes.
Our walk for these few miles was agreeable
and amusing. In all countries this is the
season of joy and festivity, and approaches
nearest the exaggerated description which
the ancient poets have given of rural happiness.
Perhaps there is in reality not so
much exaggeration in their description, as
alteration in our manners.—For, if the peasants
were allowed to enjoy the fruits of
their own labour, would not their lives be
more delightful than those of any other
people?—In spite of poverty and oppression,
a happy enthusiasm, a charming madness,
and perfect oblivion of care, are diffused
all over France during the vintage.—Every
village is enlivened with music, dancing, and
glee;—and were it not for their tattered
clothes and emaciated countenances, one
who viewed them in the vintage season,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
would imagine the country people of France
in a situation as enviable as that which, according
to the Poets, was formerly enjoyed
by the Shepherds of Arcadia.—The peasantry
of this country have not so great a
sensibility or expression of joy; and though
blessed with health, freedom, and abundance,
a composed satisfaction, a kind of
phlegmatic good-humour, mark the boundaries
of their happiness.</p>

<p>When we arrived at Basil, we went directly
to the Three Kings. This inn, in
point of situation, is the most agreeable you
can well imagine. The Rhine washes its
walls, and the windows of a large dining-room
look across that noble river to the
fertile plains on the opposite side.</p>

<p>I am just returned from that same dining-room,
where H——y and I thought proper
to sup.—There were ten or a dozen
people at table.—I sat next to a genteel-looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
man from Strasbourg, with whom I
conversed a good deal during supper. He
had for his companion a round-faced, rosy,
plump gentleman, from Amsterdam, who
did not speak French; but the Strasburgher
addressed him from time to time in Low
Dutch, to which the other replied by nods.</p>

<p>When the retreat of the greater part of
the company had contracted the little circle
which remained, I expressed some regret to
my Strasbourg acquaintance, that Mr. H——y
and I could not speak a little Dutch; or
that his friend could not speak French, that
we might enjoy the pleasure of his conversation.
This was immediately translated
to the Dutchman, who heard it with great
composure, and then took his pipe from
his mouth, and made an answer, which I
got our interpreter, with some difficulty, to
explain. It was to this effect:—That we
ought to console ourselves for the accident
of our not understanding each other; for as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
we had no connection, or dealings in trade
together, our conversing could not possibly
answer any useful purpose. H——y made
a low bow to this compliment, saying, that
the justness and good sense of that remark
had certainly escaped my observation, as he
acknowledged it had hitherto done his.</p>

<p>A man that travels, you see, my friend,
and takes care to get into good company,
is always learning something.—Had I not
visited the Three Kings at Basil, I might
have conversed all my lifetime without
knowing the true use of language.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="LETTER_XXXVIII">LETTER XXXVIII.</h2>

<p class="right">Basil.</p>

<p>There has been an interval of three
days since I had the conversation with
my ingenious acquaintance from Amsterdam.
We are assured that the chaise,
which has been accommodated with a new
axle-tree, will be ready this afternoon. In
the interim, I shall write you a few remarks
on this town.</p>

<p>Basil is larger than any town in Switzerland,
but not so populous for its size as
Geneva. The inhabitants seem to be uncommonly
afraid of thieves, most of the
windows being guarded by iron bars or
grates, like those of convents or prisons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span></p>

<p>I observed at the lower end of many
windows a kind of wooden box, projecting
towards the street, with a round glass,
of about half a foot diameter, in the middle.
I was told this was for the conveniency
of people within; who, without
being seen, choose to sit at the windows,
and amuse themselves by looking at the
passengers;—that they were mostly occupied
by the ladies, who are taught to
think it indecent to appear at the windows.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of Basil seem to be of
a reserved and saturnine disposition; whether
it is natural or affected I cannot tell,
but the few I conversed with, had something
uncommonly serious and formal in
their manner. How an unremitting gravity
and solemnity of manner in the common
affairs of life, comes to be considered
as an indication of wisdom, or of extraordinary
parts, is what I never could understand.—So<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
many ridiculous things occur
every day in this world, that men who
are endowed with that degree of sensibility
which usually accompanies genius, find it
very difficult to maintain a continued gravity.
This difficulty is abundantly felt
even in the grave and learned professions of
law, physic, and divinity; and the individuals
who have been most successful in
surmounting it, and who never deviate
from the solemnity of established forms,
have not always been the most distinguished
for real knowledge or genius; though they
generally are most admired by the multitude,
who are very apt to mistake that
gravity for wisdom, which proceeds from
a literal weight of brain, and muddiness
of understanding. Mistakes of the same
kind are frequently made in forming a
judgment of books, as well as men. Those
which profess a formal design to instruct
and reform, and carry on the work methodically
till the reader is lulled into repose,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
have passed for deep and useful performances;
while others, replete with
original observation and real instruction,
have been treated as frivolous, because they
are written in a familiar style, and the
precepts conveyed in a sprightly and indirect
manner.</p>

<p>Works which are composed with the
laborious desire of being thought profound,
have so very often the misfortune to be
dull, that some people have considered the
two terms as synonymous; and the men
who receive it as a rule, that one set of
books are profound because they are dull,
may naturally conclude that others are
superficial because they are entertaining.
With respect to books, however, matters
are soon set to rights; those of puffed and
false pretensions die neglected, while those
of real merit live and flourish. But with
regard to the men, the catastrophe is often
different; we daily see formal assuming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
blockheads flourish and enjoy the fruits of
their pompous impositions, while many
men of talents who disdain such arts, live
in obscurity, and die neglected.—I ask
you pardon, I have just recollected that I
was giving you some account of Basil.</p>

<p>The library here is much esteemed.—It
is reckoned particularly rich in manuscripts.
They showed us one of a Greek
New Testament, with which you may believe
H——y and I were greatly edified.
We are told it is above a thousand years
old.</p>

<p>At the arsenal is shown, the armour in
which Charles Duke of Burgundy was
killed. That unfortunate prince has ornamented
all the arsenals in Switzerland with
trophies.</p>

<p>We visited the hall where the famous
Council sat so many years, and voted so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
intrepidly against the Pope. Not satisfied
with condemning his conduct, they actually
damned him in effigy. A famous
painting, in the town-house, is supposed
to have been executed under their auspices.
In this piece the Devil is represented
driving the Pope and several ecclesiastics
before him to Hell.—Why they should
suppose the Devil should be so very active
against his Holiness, I know no reason.</p>

<p>Here are many pictures of Hans Holben’s
(who was a native of Basil, and the
favourite painter of Henry VIII. to whom
he was first recommended by Erasmus);
particularly, several portraits of Erasmus,
and one sketch of Sir Thomas More’s family.
Though portraits are in general the
most insipid of all kinds of paintings, yet
those of such celebrated persons, done by
such a painter, are certainly very interesting
pieces.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span></p>

<p>The most admired of all Holben’s
works, is a suite of small pieces in different
compartments, representing the passion
and sufferings of our Saviour. In these
the colours remain with wonderful vivacity.</p>

<p>We were also conducted to the dismal
gallery, upon whose walls, what is called
Holben’s Death’s Dance, is represented.
The colours having been long exposed to
the air, are now quite faded, which I can
scarce think is much to be regretted, for
the plan of the piece is so wretched, that
the finest execution could hardly prevent it
from giving disgust.</p>

<p>A skeleton, which represents Death,
leads off, in a dancing attitude, people of
both sexes, of all ages, and of every condition,
from the emperor to the beggar.
All of them display the greatest unwillingness
to accompany their hideous partner,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
who, regardless of tears, expostulations,
and bribes, draws them along.</p>

<p>You will take notice, that there is a
Death for each character, which occasions
a nauseous repetition of the same figure;
and the reluctance marked by the different
people who are forced to this hated minuet,
is in some accompanied with grimaces so
very ridiculous, that one cannot refrain
from smiling, which surely is not the effect
the painter intended to produce.—If
he did, of all the contrivances that ever
were thought of to put people in good-humour,
his must be allowed the most extraordinary.</p>

<p>To this piece, such as it is, Prior alludes
in his ode to the memory of Colonel Villers.</p>

<p>In this city all the clocks are an hour
advanced. When it is but one o’clock
in all the towns and villages around, it is
exactly two at Basil. This singularity is
of three or four hundred years standing;
and what is as singular as the custom itself,
the origin of it is not known. This is
plain, by their giving quite different accounts
of it.</p>

<p>The most popular story is, that, about
four hundred years ago, the city was
threatened with an assault by surprise.
The enemy was to begin the attack when
the large clock of the tower at one end
of the bridge should strike one after midnight.
The artist who had the care of the
clock, being informed that this was the expected
signal, caused the clock to be altered,
and it struck two instead of one; so the
enemy thinking they were an hour too late,
gave up the attempt; and in commemoration
of this deliverance, all the clocks in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
Basil have ever since struck two at one
o’clock, and so on.</p>

<p>In case this account of the matter should
not be satisfactory, they show, by way of
confirmation, a head, which is placed near
to this patriotic clock, with the face
turned to the road by which the enemy was
to have entered. This same head lolls out
its tongue every minute, in the most insulting
manner possible. This was originally
a piece of mechanical wit of the famous
clockmaker’s who saved the town. He
framed it in derision of the enemy, whom
he had so dexterously deceived. It has
been repaired, renewed, and enabled to
thrust out its tongue every minute, for these
four hundred years, by the care of the magistrates,
who think so excellent a joke cannot
be too often repeated.</p>

<p>Nothing can form a finer contrast
with the mountains of Switzerland
than the plains of Alsace. From Basil to
Strasbourg, is a continued, well cultivated
plain, as flat almost as a bowling-green.
We saw great quantities of tobacco hanging
at the peasants doors, as we came along,
this herb being plentifully cultivated in
these fields.</p>

<p>We have passed some days very agreeably
in this town. One can scarcely be at a loss
for good company and amusement, in a
place where there is a numerous French
garrison. Marechal Contades resides here
at present, as commander of the troops,
and governor of the province. He lives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
in a magnificent manner. The English who
happen to pass this way, as well as the
officers of the garrison, have great reason
to praise his hospitality and politeness.</p>

<p>After dining at his house, with several
English gentlemen, he invited the company
to his box at the playhouse. Voltaire’s
Enfant Prodigue was acted; and for
the Petite Pièce, le François à Londres.
Our nation is a little bantered, as you
know, in the last. The eyes of the spectators
were frequently turned towards the
Marechal’s box, to observe how we bore
the raillery. We clapped heartily, and
showed the most perfect good-humour.
There was indeed no reason to do otherwise.
The satire is genteel, and not too
severe; and reparation is made for the liberties
taken; for in the same piece, all
manner of justice is done to the real good
qualities belonging to the English national
character.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span></p>

<p>An old French officer, who was in the
next box to us, seemed uneasy, and hurt
at the peals of laughter which burst from
the audience at some particular passages:
he touched my shoulder, and assured me
that no nation was more respected in France
than the English;—adding, ‘Hanc veniam
damus, petimusque vicissim.’</p>

<p>It were to be wished that French characters,
when brought on the English stage,
had been always treated with as little severity,
and with equal justice; and not so
often sacrificed to the illiberal and absurd
prejudices of the vulgar.</p>

<p>I have seen the greater number of the regiments
perform their exercise separately,
and there has been one general field-day
since I came hither. The French troops are
infinitely better clothed, and in all respects
better appointed than they were during the
last war. For this reformation, I am told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
they are obliged to the Duc de Choiseul,
who, though now in disgrace, still retains
many friends in the army.</p>

<p>There are, besides the French, two German
regiments in this garrison. These admit
of the discipline of the cane upon every
slight occasion, which is never permitted
among the French troops. Notwithstanding
their being so plentifully provided with
those severe flappers to rouse their attention,
I could not perceive that the German regiments
went through their exercise with
more precision or alertness than the French;
and any difference would, in my opinion,
be dearly purchased at the price of treating
one soldier like a spaniel.</p>

<p>Perhaps what improves the hardy and
phlegmatic German, would have a contrary
effect on the more delicate and lively Frenchman;
as the same severity which is requisite
to train a pointer, would render a greyhound
good for nothing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span></p>

<p>After all, I question very much whether
this shocking custom is absolutely necessary
in the armies of any nation; for, let our
martinets say what they please, there is
surely some difference between men and
dogs.</p>

<p>With respect to the French, I am convinced
that great severity would break their
spirit, and impair that fire and impetuosity
in attack, for which they have been distinguished,
and which makes French troops
more formidable than any other quality
they possess.</p>

<p>I must own I was highly pleased with the
easy, familiar air, and appearance of good
will, with which the French officers in general
speak to the common soldiers.—This,
I am told, does not diminish the respect and
obedience which soldiers owe to their superiors,
or that degree of subordination which
military discipline exacts. On the contrary,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
it is asserted, that to these properties,
which the French possess in common with
other soldiers, they join a kind of grateful
attachment and affection.</p>

<p>In some services, the behaviour of the
officers to the private soldiers is so morose,
severe, and unrelenting, that a man might
be led to believe that one of their principal
enjoyments was to render the lives of the
common men as miserable as possible.</p>

<p>If a certain degree of gentleness does no
harm in the great articles of obedience and
subordination, it is surely worth while to
pay some attention to the feelings of so large
a proportion of mankind, as are by modern
policy necessitated to follow a military life.
To put <i>their</i> happiness entirely out of the
question, in the government of the armies
of which they form infinitely the major part,
is rather hard treatment of creatures who
are of the same species, employed in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
same cause, and exposed to the same dangers
with their officers.</p>

<p>When I began this, I intended to have
told you a few things about Strasbourg, instead
of which I have been led out of my
way by French and German soldiers.—Digressing
is a trick to which I am very subject,
and rather than not be indulged in it,
I would throw away my pen altogether.</p>

<p>The D—— of H—— arrived here exactly
at the time he proposed.</p>

<h2 id="LETTER_XL">LETTER XL.</h2>

<p class="right">Strasbourg.</p>

<p>The cathedral of Strasbourg is a very
fine building, and never fails to attract
the attention of strangers.</p>

<p>Our Gothic ancestors, like the Greeks and
Romans, built for posterity. Their ideas in
architecture, though different from those of
the Grecian artists, were vast, sublime, and
generous, far superior to the selfish snugness
of modern taste, which is generally confined
to one or two generations; the plans
of our ancestors with a more extensive benevolence
embrace distant ages. Many Gothic
buildings still habitable evince this,
and ought to inspire sentiments of gratitude
to those who have not grudged such labour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
and expence for the accommodation of their
remote posterity.</p>

<p>The number and magnitude of Gothic
churches, in the different countries of Europe,
form a presumption, that the clergy
were not devoid of public spirit in those
days; for if the powerful ecclesiastics had
then been entirely actuated by motives of
self-interest, they would have turned the
excessive influence which they had acquired
over the minds of their fellow-citizens, to
purposes more immediately advantageous to
themselves; instead of encouraging them to
raise magnificent churches for the use of the
public, they might have preached it up as
still more meritorious to build fine houses
and palaces for the immediate servants and
ambassadors of God.—But we find very few
ecclesiastical palaces, in comparison with
the number of churches which still remain
for the public conveniency. This sufficiently
shows the injustice of those indiscriminating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
satirists, who assert that the clergy in all
ages and countries have displayed a spirit
equally proud and interested.</p>

<p>No species of architecture is better contrived
for the dwelling of <i>heavenly pensive
contemplation</i>, than the Gothic; it has a
powerful tendency to fill the mind with sublime,
solemn, and religious sentiments;
the antiquity of the Gothic churches contributes
to increase that veneration which
their form and size inspire. We naturally
feel a respect for a fabric into which we
know that our forefathers have entered with
reverence, and which has stood the assaults
of many centuries, and of a thousand
storms. That religious melancholy which
usually possesses the mind in large Gothic
churches, is however considerably counteracted
by certain satirical bas reliefs with
which the pillars and cornices of this church
of Strasbourg was originally ornamented.—The
vices of monks are here exposed under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
the allegorical figure of hogs, asses, monkies,
and foxes, which being dressed in monkish
habits, perform the most venerable functions
of religion. And for the edification of those
who do not comprehend allegory, a monk
in the robes of his order, is engraved on
the pulpit in a most indecent posture, with
a nun lying by him.</p>

<p>Upon the whole, the cathedral of Strasbourg
is considered by some people as the
most impious, and by others as the merriest
Gothic church in Christendom. I leave
you to solve the problem as you please.—As
for me, I am a very unconcerned passenger.</p>

<p>I say nothing of the great clock and its
various movements. Though it was an object
of admiration when first constructed, it
is beheld with indifference by modern artists.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span></p>

<p>I had the curiosity to ascend the steeple
of this cathedral, which is reckoned one of
the highest in Europe, its height being 574
feet. You may easily form an idea of the
view from it, when I tell you it comprehends
the town of Strasbourg, the extensive
plains of Alsace, with the Rhine flowing
through them. Such views are not uncommon:
They are always agreeable, but do
not astonish and elevate the mind, like the
wild, irregular, and sublime scenes in Switzerland.</p>

<p>One forenoon as I was sauntering through
the streets with some of our countrymen,
we were informed that the music of some of
the regiments had been ordered to a particular
church, where the Count de ——,
son of Lewis the XVth by Madam de
Pompadour, was expected to be at mass.—We
all immediately went for the sake of the
military music, and found a very numerous
and genteel company attending. After<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
having waited a considerable time, it struck
twelve, upon which the whole company
retired, without hearing the music or mass.—After
mid-day the ceremony could not
have been performed, although the Count
had come. Something very important must
have intervened to prevent a Frenchman,
and one of his character for politeness, from
attending on such an occasion. There was
however a murmur of disapprobation for
this want of attention, and the priest was
not applauded, who had hazarded the souls
of a whole churchful of people, out of complaisance
to one man; for those who imagine
that a mass can save souls, must admit
that the want of it may be the cause of
damnation. Mr. H——y whispered me, “In
England they would not have had half
the complaisance for the king himself,
accompanied by all his legitimate children,
that these people have shewn to
this son of a w—e.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span></p>

<p>To indemnify myself for this disappointment,
I went the same afternoon with a
French officer to hear a celebrated preacher.
The subject of his discourse was the miserable
situation of men who were under the
dominion of their passions.—Do you wish
for a sample of his discourse?—Here it is:—“A
slave in the galleys (cried the
preacher) is happier, and more free, than
a man under the tyranny of his passions;
for though the body of the slave is in
chains, his mind may be free.—Whereas
the wretch who is under the government
of his passions, has his mind, his very
soul, in chains.—Is his passion lust?—He
will sacrifice a faithful servant to gratify
it;—David did so. Is it avarice?—he
will betray his master;—Judas did so.—Is
he attached to a mistress?—he will
murder a saint to please her;—Herod did
so.”</p>

<p>As we returned from the church, the
French officer, who had been for some time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
in a reverie, said, Ma foi, cet homme parle
avec beaucoup d’onction; je vais profiter
de son sermon.—Où est-ce que vous allez?
said I.—Je m’en vais chez Nanette, replied
he, pour me débarrasser de ma passion dominante.</p>

<p>Among the curiosities of the cathedral, I
ought to have mentioned two large bells,
which they show to strangers. One is of
brass, and weighs ten tons; the other of
silver, which they say weighs above two.—They
also show a large French horn, whose
history is as follows.—About four hundred
years ago, the Jews formed a conspiracy to
betray the city, and with this identical horn,
they intended to give the enemy notice
when to begin the attack.</p>

<p>Is it not amazing that such a number of
strange stories have been circulated concerning
these same Jews?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span></p>

<p>The plot, however, was discovered; many
of the Jews were burnt alive, the rest were
plundered of their money and effects, and
banished the town. And this horn is
sounded twice every night from the battlements
of the steeple in gratitude for the deliverance.</p>

<p>The Jews, as you would expect, deny
every circumstance of this story, except the
murdering and pillaging their countrymen.
They say the whole story was fabricated to
furnish a pretext for these robberies and
murders, and assert that the steeple of Strasbourg,
as has been said of the monument of
London,</p>

<p>All the advantages I might propose from
the D—— of H——’s company, did not
prevent my regret at parting from my friend
H——y, who set out for Lyons the same
morning on which we left Strasbourg.</p>

<p>Upon crossing the Rhine we entered into
the territories of the Margrave of Baden
Durlach, which lie along the banks of that
river immediately opposite to Alsace.</p>

<p>At Rastade we were informed that the
Margrave and his family were at Karlsruch.
Rastade is the capital of this prince’s dominions.—The
town is but small, and not very
populous:—The Margrave’s palace, however,
is sufficiently large.—We made only a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
short stay to examine it, being impatient to
get on to Karlsruch.</p>

<p>There is another very magnificent palace
at Karlsruch, built in good taste. It was
begun many years ago, and has been lately
finished by the reigning prince.</p>

<p>The town of Karlsruch is built on a regular
plan. It consists of one principal street
of above an English mile in length. This
street is at a considerable distance in front of
the palace, and in a parallel direction with
it. All the other streets go off at different
angles from the principal one, in such a manner
as that whichsoever of them you enter,
walking from it, the view is terminated by
the front of the palace. The length of
these smaller streets is ascertained, none
of them being allowed to encroach on the
spacious area, which is kept clear before
the palace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span></p>

<p>The principal street may be extented to
any length, and as many additional streets
as they please may be built from it, all of
which, according to this plan, will have the
palace for a termination.</p>

<p>The houses of this town are all as uniform
as the streets, being of an equal size and
height; so that one would be led to imagine
that none of the inhabitants are in any
considerable degree richer or poorer than
their neighbours. There are indeed a few
new houses, more elegant than the others,
belonging to some of the officers of the court,
built at one side of the palace; but they
are not, properly speaking, in the town.</p>

<p>Having announced in the usual form,
that we wished to have the honour of paying
our court to the Margrave, an officer
waited on the D—— of H—— and conducted
us to the palace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span></p>

<p>There were at dinner the reigning Prince
and Princess;—three of their sons, the eldest
of whom is married to a Princess of
Hesse Darmstadt.—She with one of her
sisters was present, also the Princess Dowager
of Bareith, daughter to the Duke of
Brunswick; two general officers in the imperial
service, and other ladies and gentlemen,
making in all a company of above
thirty at table.</p>

<p>The entertainment was splendid.—The
Margrave behaved with the politest attention
to the D—— of H——, and with affability
to every body.</p>

<p>The Princess of Bareith is of a gay,
lively, agreeable character. After dinner
the Duke took a view of the different apartments
of the palace, and afterwards walked
with the Margrave in the gardens till the
evening.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span></p>

<p>The same company were at supper; a
band of music played during the repast, and
the day went off in a more easy, agreeable
manner than I could have expected, considering
the number of Princes and Princesses.</p>

<p>The Margrave of Baden Durlach is between
forty and fifty years of age. He is a
man of learning, good sense, and benevolent
disposition. I had heard much, long before
I saw him, of his humanity and attention
to the well-being of his subjects. This
made me view him with a cordial regard,
which his rank alone could not have commanded.</p>

<p>He speaks the English language with considerable
facility, and is well acquainted with
our best authors. Solicitous that his son
should enjoy the same advantages, he has
engaged Mr. Cramer, a young gentleman
from Scotland, of an excellent character,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
who has been for several years at this court
as tutor and companion to the young Prince.</p>

<p>The German Princes are minute observers
of form. The same establishment for their
household, the same officers in the palace,
are to be found here, as in the court of the
most powerful monarch in Europe.—The
difference lies more in the salaries than in
the talents requisite for these places; one
Paymaster for the forces has greater emoluments
in England, than a Grand Marechal,
a Grand Chamberlain, two Secretaries of
State, and half a dozen more of the chief
officers of a German court, all taken together.</p>

<p>The Margrave of Baden has body guards
who do duty in the palace, foot guards who
parade before it; also horse guards and hussars,
all of whom are perfectly well equipped
and exactly disciplined;—a piece of magnificence
which seems to be adopted by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
this prince, merely in conformity with the
custom long established in his country.</p>

<p>He keeps on foot no other troops besides
the few which are necessary for this duty
at the palace, though his revenue is more
considerable, and his finances are in much
better order than some Princes in Germany
who have little standing armies in constant
pay. He has too just an understanding not
to perceive that the greatest army he could
possibly maintain, could be no defence to his
dominions, situated as they are between the
powerful states of France and Austria: And
probably his principles and disposition prevent
him from thinking of filling his coffers
by hiring his subjects to foreign powers.</p>

<p>If he were so inclined, there is no manner
of doubt that he might sell the persons
of his subjects as soldiers, or employ them
in any other way he should think proper;
for he, as well as the other sovereign Princes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
in Germany, has an unlimited power
over his people. If you ask the question,
in direct terms, of a German, he will answer
in the negative; and will talk of certain
rights which the subjects enjoy; and that
they can appeal to the great council or general
diet of the empire for relief. But
after all his ingenuity and distinctions, you
find that the barriers which protect the peasant
from the power of the prince, are so
very weak, that they are hardly worth
keeping up, and that the only security the
peasant has for his person or property, must
proceed from the moderation, good sense,
and justice of his sovereign.</p>

<p>Happy would it be for mankind if this
unlimited power were always placed in as
equitable hands as those of the Margrave of
Baden, who employs it entirely for the
good of his subjects, by whom he is adored!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span></p>

<p>This Prince endeavours, by every means
he can devise, to introduce industry and manufactures
among his people.—There is a
considerable number of English tradesmen
here, who make Birmingham work, and
instruct the inhabitants in that business.
He has also engaged many watch-makers
from Geneva to settle here, by granting
them encouragements and privileges of every
kind, and allows no opportunity to slip unimproved,
by which he can promote the
comfort and happiness of his people: A
prince of such a character is certainly a
public blessing, and the people are fortunate
who are born under his government;
But far more fortunate they who are born
under a government which can protect
them, independent of the virtues, and in
spite of the vices, of their sovereign.</p>

<p>When we left Karlsruch, the Margrave
gave orders that we might be allowed to
pass by a road lately finished, through a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
noble forest, several leagues in length. After
having traversed this, we fell in with the
common posting road, entered the bishop
of Spires’s territories, passed by the town of
that name, proceeded to the Electorate of
Palatine, and arrived the same night at
Manheim.</p>

<p>All the countries I have mentioned form
one rich fertile plain; there are few or no
gentlemen’s houses to vary the scene; nothing
but the palace of the prince and the
cottages of the peasants, the gentry living
in dependence at court, and the merchants
and manufacturers in the towns.</p>

<h2 id="LETTER_XLII">LETTER XLII.</h2>

<p class="right">Manheim.</p>

<p>This is generally reckoned one of the
most beautiful cities in Germany.
The streets are all as straight as arrows,
being what they call tirées au cordeau, and
intersect each other at right angles. This
never fails to please at first, but becomes
sooner tiresome than a town built with less
regularity. When a man has walked
through the town for half a forenoon, his
eyes search in vain for variety: the same
objects seem to move along with him, as if
he had been all the while a ship-board.</p>

<p>They calculate the number of inhabitants
at 24,000, including the garrison, which
consists of 5000 men. This town has three
noble gates, adorned with basso relievos very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
beautifully executed. The Duke and I
walked round the ramparts with ease in the
space of an hour. The fortifications are
well contrived and in good order, and the
town acquires great additional strength from
being almost entirely surrounded by the
Neckar and the Rhine, and situated in a flat,
not commanded by any rising ground. Yet
perhaps it would be better that this city
were quite open, and without any fortification.
An attempt to defend it might prove
the destruction of the citizens’ houses, and
the electoral palace. A palace is injudiciously
situated when built within a fortified
town, because a threat from the enemy
to bombard it, might induce the garrison
to surrender.</p>

<p>The Electoral palace is a most magnificent
structure, situated at the junction of the
Rhine and the Neckar.—The cabinet of natural
curiosities, and the collection of pictures,
are much vaunted. To examine them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
was amusing enough:—To describe them
would, I fear, be a little tedious.</p>

<p>The Elector himself is a man of taste
and magnificence, circumstances in his character,
which probably afford more pleasure
to himself, and the strangers who pass this
way, than to his own subjects.</p>

<p>I accompanied the D—— to one of the officers
of the court, whose business it is to
present strangers. This gentleman is remarkable
for his amazing knowledge in all
the mysteries of etiquette. He entertained
his Grace with much erudition on this subject.—I
never observed the D—— yawn so
very much.—When our visit was over, he
asserted that it had lasted two hours.—Upon
examining his watch, he discovered that he
had made a mistake of one hour and forty
minutes only.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span></p>

<p>We were presented the following day to
the Elector and the Electress. He was
dressed in the uniform of his guards, seems
to be on the borders of fifty, and has a sensible
manly countenance, which I am told
is the true index of his character.</p>

<p>The Hereditary Prince is a young man of
knowledge and good sense. He surprised
me by talking of the party-disputes and adventures
which have happened of late years
in England, of which I found him minutely
informed.—Many people in Germany
have the English news-papers and political
pamphlets regularly transmitted to them.
The acrimony and freedom with which the
highest characters are treated, astonish and
amuse them, and from these they often form
very false and extraordinary conclusions with
regard to the state of the nation.</p>

<p>As the Elector intends soon to visit Italy,
great numbers of officers have come hither<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
to pay their duty to their sovereign before
he depart for that country. He is much
esteemed by his officers, with whom he
lives in a very affable manner. There are
generally thirty covers every day at his table
for them, and the strangers who happen to
be at the court of Manheim.</p>

<p>One day at dinner, a kind of buffoon came
into the room. He walked round the table,
and conversed in a familiar manner with
every body present, the princes not excepted.
His observations were followed by
loud bursts of applause from all whom he
addressed. As he spoke in German, I could
not judge of his wit, but stared around with
the anxiety of countenance natural to a man
who sees a whole company ready to die
with laughter at a jest which he cannot
comprehend. An old officer, who sat near
me, was touched with compassion for my
situation, and explained in French some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
of the most brilliant repartees for my private
use.</p>

<p>As this good-natured officer did not seem
to have a great command of the French language,
the whole spirit of the jest was allowed
to evaporate during the translation:—At
least I could not smell a particle when
the process was over. However, as these
translations evidently cost him a good deal
of trouble, I thought myself obliged to
seem delighted with his performance; so I
joined in the mirth of the company, and
endeavoured to laugh as much as any person
at the table.</p>

<p>My interpreter afterwards informed me
that this genius was from the Tyrol, that
he spoke the German with so peculiar an
accent, that whatever he said never failed to
set the whole table in a roar; c’est pourquoi,
added he, il est en possession d’entrer toujours
avec le dessert.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span></p>

<p>This is the only example that I know
remaining of a court fool or licensed jester;
an office formerly in all the courts of
Europe.</p>

<p class="right">Manheim.</p>

<p>We made a short jaunt to Heidelberg a
few days since. That town is about
four leagues from Manheim.</p>

<p>Heidelberg is situated in a hollow on the
banks of the Neckar, and is surrounded by
charming hills perfectly cultivated.</p>

<p>More cheerful scenes of exuberant fertility
are to be seen no where than along the
fine chain of hills which begin near this
town. The summits of these hills are
crowned with trees, and their sides and
bottoms are clothed with vines.</p>

<p>The Elector’s castle is placed on an eminence,
which commands the town, and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
view of the valley below; but the castle itself
unfortunately is commanded by another
eminence too near it, from which this noble
building was cannonaded when the whole
Palatinate was pillaged and burnt, in consequence
of that cruel order of Lewis XIV.
too literally executed by Turenne.</p>

<p>The particulars of that dismal scene have
been transmitted from father to son, and are
still spoke of with horror by the peasantry
of this country, among whom the French
nation is held in detestation to this day.</p>

<p>While we were in the castle we did not
omit visiting the renowned Heidelberg tun;
but as it was perfectly empty, it made but
a dull and uninteresting appearance.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of the Palatinate are
partly Protestants, and partly Roman Catholics,
who live here in harmony with each
other. The great church at Heidelberg is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
divided into two apartments, in one of
which the Protestants, and in the other, the
Papists, perform public worship:—A singular
proof of the moderation and coolness of
people’s minds with regard to a subject that
inflamed them so violently in the days of
their ancestors.</p>

<p>We remained only one day at Heidelberg,
and returned in the evening to this place.
The lives and manners of the inhabitants of
this city seem to be as uniform and formal
as the streets and buildings. No noise, mobs
or bustle; at mid-day every thing is as calm
and quiet as the streets of London at midnight.
This gives one the notion that the
citizens are under the same restraint and
discipline with the troops.</p>

<p>I have seen these last perform their exercise
every morning on the parade. I was
a good deal surprised to observe, that not
only the movements of the soldiers muskets,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
and the attitudes of their bodies, but also
their devotions, were under the direction of
the major’s cane. The following motions
are performed as part of the military manœuvres
every day before the troops are
marched to their different guards.</p>

<p>The major flourishes his cane;—the drum
gives a single tap, and every man under arms
raises his hand to his hat;—at a second
stroke on the drum, they take off their hats,
and are supposed to pray;—at a third, they
finish their petitions, and put their hats on
their heads.—If any man has the assurance
to prolong his prayer a minute longer than
the drum indicates, he is punished on the
spot, and taught to be less devout for the
future.</p>

<p>The ingenious inventor of drums certainly
never dreamt of their becoming the regulators
of people’s piety.—But the modern improvements
in the military art are truly wonderful!—and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
we need not despair, after
this, of seeing a whole regiment, by the
progress of discipline, so modelled as to eat,
drink, and perform other animal functions,
uniformly together, at the word of command,
as they poise their firelocks.</p>

<h2 id="LETTER_XLIV">LETTER XLIV.</h2>

<p class="right">Manheim.</p>

<p>Having left orders at Geneva to forward
all our letters of a certain date to
Manheim, and to direct those which should
come afterwards, to Frankfort on the Maine,
I had the good fortune to receive yours last
night.</p>

<p>I feel as much indignation as you possibly
can, against those who endeavour to hurt the
peace of families by malignant publications,
and I enter fully into Lord ——’s on so unmerited
an attack. Yet I should be heartily
sorry to see these evils remedied by any restriction
on the freedom of the press; because
I am every day more and more convinced
that its unrestrained productions, the
licentious news-papers themselves not excepted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
have conveyed to every corner of
Great Britain, along with much impertinence
and scurrility, such a regard for the
constitution, such a sense of the rights of
the subject, and such a degree of general
knowledge, as never were so universally diffused
over any other nation. Such a law as
your friend proposes might, no doubt, protect
individuals from unjust attacks in print:
but it would at the same time remove one
great means of clearing their innocence, and
making known their wrongs, when injured
in a more essential manner. It would limit
the right which every Briton has of publicly
addressing his countrymen, when he finds
himself injured or oppressed by the perversion
of law, or the insolence of office.</p>

<p>Examples might be given of men of great
integrity being attacked in the most cruel
and ungenerous manner by people high in
office and guarded by power. Such men
had no other means of redress than that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
appealing to the candour and good sense of
the public, which they used with success.
Every man’s observation may suggest to him
many kinds of injustice and oppression which
the rich, the insidious, or the powerful, can
commit in spite of law, or perhaps by the
aid of law, against the poor, the unsuspecting,
and the friendless.—Many, who
can silence conscience and evade law, tremble
at the thoughts of their injustice being
published; and nothing is, nothing can be,
a greater check to the wantonness of power,
than the privilege of unfolding private grievances
at the bar of the public. For thus the
cause of individuals is made a public concern,
and the general indignation which
their wrongs excite, forms at once one of
the severest punishments which can be inflicted
on the oppressor, and one of the
strongest bulwarks that can be raised in defence
of the unprotected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span></p>

<p>By this means also the most speedy and
effectual alarm is given all over the nation
when any great public misconduct happens,
or upon any appearance of a design against
the constitution; and many evils are detected
and prevented, which otherwise might
have been unobserved, till they had become
too strong for remedy. And though this
liberty produces much silly advice, and malignant
censors without number, it likewise
opens the door to some of a different
character, who give useful hints to ministers,
which would have been lost without the
freedom of anonymous publication.</p>

<p>The temporary and partial disorders,
which are the consequences of public freedom,
have been greatly exaggerated by some
people, and represented as more than equivalent
to all the advantages resulting from a
free government. But if such persons had
opportunities of observing the nature of those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
evils which spring up in absolute governments,
they would soon be convinced of
their error.</p>

<p>The greatest evil that can arise from the
licentiousness which accompanies civil liberty
is, that people may rashly take a dislike
to liberty herself, from the teasing impertinence
and absurdity of some of her real or
affected well-wishers; as a man might become
less fond of the company of his best
friend, if he found him always attended by
a snappish cur, which without provocation
was always growling and barking.</p>

<p>But to prove the weakness of such conduct,
we have only to call to mind that the
stream of licentiousness perhaps never rose
higher than it did some years since in England.—And
what were the mighty evils that
followed?—Many respectable characters
were grossly misrepresented in printed publications.—Certain
daring scribblers evaded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
the punishment they deserved:—Many windows
were broken, and the chariots of a
few members of parliament were bespattered
with dirt by the mob.—What are
these frivolous disorders when compared
to the gloomy regularity produced by despotism;
in which men are obliged to the most
painful circumspection in all their actions;
are afraid to speak their sentiments on the
most common occurrences; suspicious of
cherishing government spies in their household
servants; distrustful of their own relations
and most intimate companions, and
at all times exposed to the oppression of
men in power, and to the insolence of their
favourites?—No confusion, in my mind,
can be more terrible than the stern disciplined
regularity and vaunted police of arbitrary
governments, where every heart is depressed
by fear, where mankind dare not
assume their natural characters, where the
free spirit must crouch to the slave in office,
where genius must repress her effusions, or,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
like the Egyptian worshippers, offer them
in sacrifice to the calves of power; and
where the human mind, always in shackles,
shrinks from every generous effort.</p>

<p class="right">Mentz.</p>

<p>We left Manheim five or six days ago.
It is very easy travelling through this
part of Germany, the roads being perfectly
good, and the country a continued plain.
From Basil to within a few miles of Mentz,
the posting road does not make even the
most gentle ascent; a vast length of country
to be all along a perfect level.</p>

<p>By the great numbers of Monks and
Friars, of all colours and conditions, that
are to be met near this city, we were apprised
of our entrance into an ecclesiastical
state, while the plump persons and rosy
complexions of these Fathers sufficiently
proved, that they did not live in the fertile
land of Rhenish for nothing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span></p>

<p>However good Christians they might be,
many of them had much the appearance of
paying occasional homage to the ancient
heathen deity Bacchus, without being restrained
in their worship like the soldiers
on the parade at Manheim.—One of them
in particular appeared to have just arisen
from his devotion.—He moved along in
the most unconcerned manner imaginable,
without observing any direct course, or regarding
whether he went to the right hand
or to the left. He muttered to himself as
he went.—Does he repeat his pater-noster?
said I.—I rather imagine he prays from
Horace, replied the D——</p>

<p>On both sides of the Rhine the ground
here begins to become hilly and irregular,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
forming banks finely exposed to the sun.
Here the best Rhenish wine is produced, and
even a very small portion of these exuberant
banks is of considerable value. A chain of
well-inhabited villages runs along from
Mentz, by Bacharach, all the way to Coblentz,
where the Rhine is joined by the
Moselle.</p>

<p>Bacharach is said to derive its name from
an altar of Bacchus (Bacchi Ara) supposed
to have been erected by the Romans in
gratitude for the quantity and quality of
the wine produced in the neighbourhood.
A little before we entered Mentz, we
passed by the Favorita, a beautiful palace
belonging to the Elector, situated where
the Rhine is joined by the Maine.</p>

<p>Mentz is finely situated, built in an
irregular manner, and most plentifully provided
with churches. The cathedral is but
a gloomy fabric. In this there is what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
they call a treasury, which contains a
number of clumsy jewels, some relics,
and a mighty rich wardrobe of priests vestments.</p>

<p>There are some troops in this capital,
but I do not think the officers have that
smart presumptuous air which generally
accompanies men of their profession. They
seem conscious that the clergy are their
masters; and, I have a notion, are a little
out of countenance on that account.</p>

<p>The streets swarm with ecclesiastics,
some of them in fine coaches, and attended
by a great number of servants. I remarked
also many genteel airy abbés; who, one
could easily see, were the most fashionable
people, and give the ton at this place.</p>

<p>Though it is most evident that in this
electorate the clergy have taken exceeding
good care of themselves; yet, in justice to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
them, it must be acknowledged, that the
people also seem to be in an easy situation.
The peasantry appear to be in a state of far
greater abundance than those of France, or
even those in the Elector of Manheim’s
dominions.</p>

<p>I have some desire to see an ecclesiastical
court, and would willingly visit this of
Mentz; but the D—— of H——, who
seems to have no excessive fondness for any
court, says, a court of clergymen must be
more dismal and tedious than any other,
and I fear will not be prevailed on to appear
at this; in which case we shall leave this
place to-morrow morning early, without
further ceremony.</p>

<h2 id="LETTER_XLVI">LETTER XLVI.</h2>

<p class="right">Frankfort on the Maine.</p>

<p>We have been here two weeks.—To
form a proper judgment of the genius
and manners of any nation, it is necessary
to live familiarly with the inhabitants
for a considerable time; but a smaller degree
of observation will suffice to give a pretty
just idea of the nature of its government.
The chilling effects of despotic oppression,
or the benign influence of freedom and
commerce, strike the eye of the most careless
traveller.</p>

<p>The streets of Frankfort are spacious and
well-paved; the houses stately, clean, and
convenient; the shops well furnished; the
dress, the numbers, the air, and general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
manners of the inhabitants, sufficiently
show, without other information, that there
is no little despot within their walls, to
impoverish them in support of his grandeur,
and to put every action of their lives,
every movement of their bodies, under restraint
by his caprice.</p>

<p>The houses are of brick, but have a
better appearance than brick houses in general,
owing chiefly to their being covered
with a kind of reddish stucco, which is
come into use here of late, and, it is believed,
will render the buildings more
durable. The fronts of many of the finest
are also adorned with bas reliefs, of white
stucco, in imitation of marble. These
white ornaments, on the red ground, form
too strong a contrast, and do not please an
eye fond of simplicity. But the Germans,
in general, have a taste for showy ornament,
in their dress, furniture, and houses.
Frankfort is a free imperial city, having a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
small territory belonging to it, and is governed
by its own magistracy.</p>

<p>All religions are tolerated here, under
certain restrictions; but Lutheranism is
the established faith, as the magistrates are
of that communion.</p>

<p>The principal church is in the possession
of the Roman Catholics, but no public
procession of the host is permitted through
the streets. All the ceremonies of their
religion are confined to the houses of individuals,
or performed within the walls of
this church. In it there is a chapel, to
which the emperor is conducted immediately
after his election, in order to be
crowned by the Elector of Mentz.</p>

<p>The Jews have a synagogue in this city,
where they perform their religious rites;
but the Calvinists have never been allowed
any public house of worship within the territory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
of Frankfort. They attend divine
service at a place called Bockenheim in the
county of Hanau, where they have built a
church.</p>

<p>This is but unkind treatment; and it
seems, at first sight, a little extraordinary,
that Martin Luther should show more indulgence
to his old enemy Lord Peter, and
even to Judas Iscariot himself, than to his
fellow-reformer John Calvin.</p>

<p>Though Frankfort is thought a fine
town, and the effect produced by the whole
is magnificent, yet there are no buildings
in particular worthy of attention. It is
expected, however, that all strangers
should visit the town-house, and see the
chamber where the Emperor is elected.
And it would be reckoned a great want of
curiosity, not to see the famous golden bull
which is kept there with the utmost care.
A sight of this costs a golden ducat; a sufficient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
price for a glance of an old manuscript,
which not one person in a hundred
can read, and still fewer can understand.</p>

<p>A countryman of ours, who expected
more amusement for his money, complained
loudly of this as an imposition, and
on hearing a German talk of the high price
which every thing bore in England, he retorted
on him in these words:—Il n’y a
rien en Angleterre si cher que votre <i>taureau</i>
d’or à Frankfort.</p>

<p>There is a custom observed here, which
I shall mention on account of its singularity,
though I enquired in vain for its origin.
Two women appear every day at noon on
the battlements of the principal steeple,
and play some very solemn airs with trumpets.
This music is accompanied by vocal
psalmody, performed by four or five men,
who always attend the female trumpeters
for that purpose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span></p>

<p>The people here have a violent taste for
psalm-singing. There are a considerable
number of men and boys, who have this
for their only profession. They are engaged
by some families to officiate two or three
times a week in the morning, before the
master and mistress of the family get out of
bed.</p>

<p>When any person in tolerable circumstances
dies, a band of these sweet singers
assemble in the streets before the house,
and chant an hour every day to the corpse,
till it is interred. The same band accompanies
the funeral, singing hymns all the
way.</p>

<p>Funerals are conducted with an uncommon
degree of solemnity in this town:—A
man clothed in a black cloak, and carrying
a crucifix, at the end of a long pole,
leads the procession:—A great number of
hired mourners in the same dress, and each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
with a lemon in his hand, march after
him:—Then come the singers, followed
by the corpse in a hearse; and lastly, the
relations in mourning coaches.</p>

<p>The crucifix is carried in this manner at
all funerals, whether the deceased has died
a Roman Catholic, a Lutheran, or a Calvinist.
That this custom should be followed
by the two latter, surprised me a
good deal. I should have imagined that
the Calvinists in particular, whatever they
did with the lemons, would never have
been able to digest the crucifix.</p>

<p>There is a very considerable number of
Calvinists in this place; it is generally
thought they are the most industrious.
They unquestionably are the richest part
of the inhabitants. This may be partly
owing to a circumstance that some of them
consider as a hardship—their being excluded
from any share in the government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
of the city.—Many of the Calvinist families
are descendents of French Protestants,
who left their country at the revocation of
the edict of Nantz.</p>

<p>There are some villages near Frankfort
consisting entirely of French refugees; who,
deserting their country at the same time,
have settled here in a cluster. Their descendents
speak French in their common
conversation, and retain many of their original
customs to this hour.</p>

<p>Two or three families now living at
Frankfort are of English origin. Their
predecessors fled first to Holland, during
the persecutions in the reign of Mary, and
being afterwards driven out of that country
by the cruelty of the Duke of Alva, they
at length found an asylum for themselves,
and their posterity, in this free imperial
city.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span></p>

<p>The number of Jews in Frankfort is
prodigious, considering one dismal inconvenience
they are subjected to, being
obliged to live all together in a single street
built up at one end:—There is a large gate
at the other, which is regularly shut at a
certain hour of the night, after which no
Jews dare appear in the streets; but the
whole herd must remain cooped and
crowded together, like so many black cattle,
till morning. As this street is narrow,
the room allotted for each family
small, and as the children of Israel were
never remarkable for their cleanliness, and
always noted for breeding, the Jews quarter,
you will believe, is not the sweetest
part of the town. I scarce think they could
have been worse lodged in the land of
Egypt.</p>

<p>They have several times made offer of
considerable sums to the magistrates of
Frankfort for liberty to build or purchase<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
another street for their accommodation;
but all such proposals have hitherto been
rejected.</p>

<p>The Jews in Frankfort are obliged to
fetch water when a fire happens in any
part of the city, and the magistrates in return
permit them to choose judges out of
their own body for deciding disputes among
themselves; but if either party refuses to
submit to this, an appeal is open to the
magistrates.</p>

<p>They must unquestionably enjoy some
great advantages by the trade they carry on,
to compensate for such inconveniencies.
During the day-time they are allowed the
liberty of walking all over the town; a
privilege which they improve with equal
assiduity and address. They attack you in
the street, ply at the gate of your lodgings,
and even glide into your apartments, offering
to supply you with every commodity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
you can have occasion for: And if you
happen to pass by the entrance of their
street, they intreat your custom with the
violence and vociferation of so many
Thames watermen.</p>

<p>I was twice at their synagogue. There
is nothing magnificent in their worship;
but much apparent zeal and fervour. I
saw one of their most important rites performed
on two children. It was impossible
not to feel compassion for the poor infants,
thus cruelly initiated into a community,
who had formerly the misfortune of being
despised by the Heathens, and now are
execrated by all pious Christians.</p>

<p>Society here is divided into Noblesse and
the Bourgeois. The first consists of some
noble families from various parts of Germany,
who have chosen Frankfort for their
residence, and a few original citizens of
Frankfort, but who have now obtained the
rank of nobility. The citizens who connect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
themselves with strangers, have made
their fortunes by commerce, which some of
them still follow.</p>

<p>There is a public assembly for the nobility
once a week, at which they drink tea,
converse, or play at cards from six to ten.
On the other nights, the same company
meet alternately at each other’s houses, and
pass the evening in the same manner. None
of the Bourgeois families are invited to these
parties; but they have assemblies of the same
kind among themselves, and often entertain
their friends, and the strangers with whom
they are acquainted, in a very hospitable
manner at their tables. The noblemen
who reside in Frankfort, and the nobility of
all degrees, and of every nation, who accidentally
pass through it, cheerfully accept of
these invitations to dine with the citizens, but
none of the German ladies of quality condescend
so far. While their fathers, husbands,
and brothers, are entertained at a Bourgeois<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
table, they chuse rather to dine at home by
themselves; and they certainly judge wisely,
if they prefer a spare diet to good cheer.</p>

<p>The distinction of ranks is observed in
Germany, with all the scrupulous precision
that a matter of that importance deserves.
There is a public concert in this place supported
by subscription. One would imagine
that the subscribers would take their seats as
they entered the room, that those who came
earliest would have their choice.—No such
matter.—The two first rows are kept for the
ladies of quality, and the wives and daughters
of the citizens must be contented to sit
behind, let them come at what hour, and
pay what money they please.—After all,
this is not so bad as in an assembly of nobility,
where commons are not permitted
to sit, even in the lobby, whatever price
they may have paid for their seat in parliament.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span></p>

<p>Since we arrived, the theatre has been
opened for the winter, by a troop of German
comedians. I was there the first night;
previous to the play, there was a kind of allegorical
prologue, intended as a compliment
to the magistrates of Frankfort. This was
performed by Justice, Wisdom, and Plenty,
each of whom appeared in person, with the
usual attributes. The last was very properly
personated by a large fat woman, big
with child. As to the two former, I hope,
for the sake of the good people of Frankfort,
that they are better represented in the town-council,
than they were on the stage. This
prologue was concluded by a long harangue
pronounced by the plumpest Apollo, I dare
venture to say, that ever appeared in the
heavens above, or on the earth beneath.</p>

<p>After this the play began, which was a
German translation of the English play of
George Barnwell, with considerable alterations.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
Barnwell is represented as an imprudent
young man; but he does not murder
his uncle, as in the English play, or commit
any gross crime; the German translator
therefore, instead of hanging, only marries
him at the end of the piece.</p>

<p>Most of the plays represented on the German
stage, are translations from the English
or French; for Germany, so fertile in writers
in divinity, jurisprudence, medicine,
chymistry, and other parts of natural philosophy,
has produced few poets till of late.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Jam nova progenies cœlo demittitur alto,</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and the German muse is now admired all
over Europe. Her beauties are felt and applauded
by men of genius, even through the
medium of a translation, which is a strong
proof of her original energy. It must, however,
be a great discouragement to German
poetry in general, and to the dramatic in
particular, that the French language prevails<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
in all the courts, and that French plays are
represented there in preference to German.</p>

<p>The native language of the country is
treated like a vulgar and provincial dialect,
while the French is cultivated as the only
proper language for people of fashion.—Children
of the first families are instructed
in French, before they acquire their mother-tongue,
and pains are taken to keep them
ignorant of this, that it may not hurt their
pronunciation of the other. I have met with
people who considered it as an accomplishment
to be unable to express themselves in
the language of their country, and who
have pretended to be more ignorant, in this
particular, than they were in reality.</p>

<p>I have been assured by many, who understand
the German language well, that it is
nervous, copious, most expressive, and capable
of all the graces of poetry. The truth
of this appears by the works of several late<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
writers, who have endeavoured to check this
unnatural prejudice in their countrymen,
and to restore the language of their ancestors
to its native honours.—But what are the
efforts of good sense, taste, and genius, in
opposition to fashion, and the influence of
courts?</p>

<p>Among the winter amusements of this
place, traineau parties may be reckoned.
These can take place in the time of frost
only, and when there is a considerable quantity
of snow upon the ground. I had an
opportunity of seeing a very splendid entertainment
of this kind lately, which was
given by some young gentlemen to an equal
number of ladies.</p>

<p>A traineau is a machine in the shape of a
horse, lion, swan; or in that of a griffin,
unicorn, or some other fanciful form, without
wheels; but made below like a sledge,
for the conveniency of sliding over the snow.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
Some are gilded, and otherwise ornamented,
according to the whim of the proprietor.—A
pole stands up from one side, to which an
ensign or flag is fastened, which waves over
the heads of those placed on the machine.
The lady, wrapped in fur, sits before, and
the gentleman stands behind on a board
made for that purpose.</p>

<p>The whole is drawn by two horses, which
are either conducted by a postillion, or driven
by the gentleman.—The horses are gaudily
ornamented, and have bells hanging from
the trappings which cover them.</p>

<p>This party consisted of about thirty
traineaus, each attended by two or three
servants on horseback with flambeaux; for
this amusement was taken when it began to
grow dark.—One traineau took the lead;—the
rest followed at a convenient distance in
a line, and drove for two or three hours
through the principal streets and squares of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
Frankfort.—The horses go at a brisk trot or
canter; the motion of the traineau is easy
and agreeable; the bells, ensigns, and
torches, make a very gay and showy appearance,
which seemed to be much relished
by the parties immediately concerned, and
admired by the spectators.</p>

<p>A few days after this exhibition, as
we were preparing to set out for Hanau
in a traineau, Mr. S——, brother to Lord
S——, arrived at the inn. Though he had
travelled for two days and nights, without
having been in bed, he was so little
fatigued, that he went along with us. Hanau
is some leagues distant from Frankfort.
We had a full proof of the smooth movement
of the traineau, which, in the time
of frost, and when there is a proper quantity
of snow on the ground, is certainly
the most delightful way of travelling that
can possibly be imagined.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span></p>

<p>Hanau is the residence of the Hereditary
Prince of Hesse Cassel. As we entered the
town we met the Princess, who is sister-in-law
to the King of Denmark. She, with
some of the ladies of the court, was taking
the air also in a traineau.</p>

<p>Besides the troops of Hanau, two regiments
of Hanoverians are there at present.
The Hereditary Prince is not on the best
terms with his father. He lives here, however,
in a state of independency, possessed
of the revenues of this country, which is
guaranteed to him by the Kings of Britain,
Denmark, and Prussia: but there is no intercourse
between this little court and that
of Hesse Cassel.</p>

<p>After dinner we returned to Frankfort.
The D—— prevailed with Mr. S—— to remain
a longer time at Frankfort than he had intended.
He is a sensible young man of spirit
and ambition. His grandfather, the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
Earl of D——, endeavours to seduce him into
holy orders, promising him a living of 2000l.
a year, which is in the gift of the family.
This you will acknowledge to be a temptation
which few younger brothers could withstand.
Nature, however, seems to have
destined this young gentleman for another
line in life. My own opinion is, he would
rather have the command of a troop of dragoons,
than be promoted to the See of
Canterbury.</p>

<h2 id="LETTER_XLVIII">LETTER XLVIII.</h2>

<p class="right">Frankfort.</p>

<p>Some of the nobility who reside in this
city, take every opportunity of pointing
out the essential difference that there is, and
the distinctions that ought to be made, between
their families and those of the Bourgeois,
who, though they have, by commerce
or some profession equally ignoble, attained
great wealth, which enables them to live in
a stile of magnificence unbecoming their
rank; yet their noble neighbours insinuate,
that they always retain a vulgarity of sentiment
and manners, unknown to those whose
blood has flowed pure through several generations,
unmixed with that puddle which
stagnates in the veins of plebeians.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span></p>

<p>The D—— of H—— does not seem to have
studied natural philosophy with accuracy
sufficient to enable him to observe this distinction.
He mingles in the societies of the
citizens, with as much ease and alacrity, as
in those of the nobility, dining with the
one, and drinking coffee with the other, in
the most impartial manner, and between
the two he contrives to amuse himself
tolerably well.</p>

<p>The two families with which we are in
the greatest degree of intimacy, are those of
Mons. de Barkhause, and Mons. P. Gogle.
The former is a principal person in the magistracy,
a man of learning and worth. His
lady is of a noble family in the dukedom of
Brunswic, a woman of admirable good
sense and many accomplishments. She is
well acquainted with English and French
literature. The French language she speaks
like a native, and though she cannot converse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
in English without difficulty, she understands
and relishes the works of some of our
best authors.</p>

<p>Mr. Gogle has travelled over the greatest
part of Europe, and is equally acquainted
with men and books. He has made a plentiful
fortune by commerce, and lives in a
very agreeable and hospitable manner.</p>

<p>In these two houses we occasionally meet
with the best company of both the classes of
society in this place, and in one or other when
there is no public assembly we generally pass
the afternoon.—The former part of the day
(a thaw having lately dissolved the snow)
we often pass in jaunts to the environs of
this place, which are very beautiful.</p>

<p>As the D—— of H—— and I were riding
one day along the banks of the Maine, near
the village of Heix, which is in the territories
of the Elector of Mentz, we observed a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
building which seemed to be the residence
of some prince, or bishop at least. We were
surprised we never had heard it spoken of,
as it had a more magnificent appearance
than any modern building we had seen since
our arrival in Germany. We rode up, and
upon entering it, found that the apartments
within, though not laid out in the best taste,
seemed to correspond, in point of expence,
with the external appearance.</p>

<p>We were informed by the workmen, who
were employed in finishing these apartments,
that this palace belonged to a tobacconist
in Frankfort, where he still kept shop,
and had accumulated a prodigious fortune
by making and selling snuff.</p>

<p>Near to the principal house, there is
another great building intended for a workhouse,
in which tobacco is to be manufactured,
with many apartments for the
workmen, and vaulted cellars in which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
various kinds of snuff are to be kept moist,
till sent for inland sale to Frankfort, or
shipped on the Maine for foreign markets.</p>

<p>The owner informed us, there were exactly
three hundred rooms in both buildings, and
the greater number of these belonged to the
dwelling-house. We did not chuse to puzzle
the man by difficult questions, and therefore
refrained from enquiring, what use he intended
to make of such an amazing number
of rooms, which seemed rather contrived as
barracks for two or three thousand soldiers,
than any other purpose.</p>

<p>On our return to town, we were informed
that this person, who is not a native of
Frankfort, though he has been many years
established there, had applied to the magistrates
for liberty to purchase a certain spot
of ground, on which he proposed to build a
dwelling-house, &amp;c. which cannot be done
by any but citizens, without the consent of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
the council. This being refused, he bought
a little piece of land in the territory of
Mentz, immediately beyond that of Frankfort,
and on the banks of the Maine; and
being highly piqued by the refusal he had
met with from the magistrates, he had
reared a building greatly larger and more
extensive than was necessary, or than he at
first had intended, in the full persuasion that
the remorse of the magistrates would be in
proportion to the size of this fabric.</p>

<p>The tobacconist has already expended
fifty thousand pounds on this temple of
vengeance, and his wrath against the magistrates
seems to be yet unappeased—for he
still lavishes his money with a rancour
against these unfortunate men, that is very
unbecoming a Christian. The inhabitants
of Frankfort, while they acknowledge the
imprudence of the magistrates, do not applaud
the wisdom of their antagonist, in
whose brain they assert there must be some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
apartments as empty as any in the vast
structure he is building.</p>

<p>Another day his Grace and I rode to
Bergen, a small village which has been rendered
eminent by the attempt made there
by Prince Ferdinand on the French army
in the year 1759.</p>

<p>We were accompanied by the Messrs. de
Lessener, two gentlemen, now retired from
the service, and living at Frankfort, who
had been in the action, one a Captain in the
Hanoverian army, the other of the same
rank in the French.</p>

<p>During the winter of that memorable
year, you may remember that the French,
with more policy than justice, had seized
upon this neutral city, and established their
head-quarters here. This was attended by
great advantages, securing to them the course
of the Maine and Upper Rhine, by which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
they received supplies from Strasbourg, and
all the intermediate cities.</p>

<p>Prince Ferdinand having formed the design
of driving them from this advantageous
situation, before they could be reinforced,
suddenly assembled his army, which was
cantoned about Munster, and after three
days of forced marches, came in sight of the
French army, at that time commanded by
the Duke de Broglio, who, having received
intelligence of the Prince’s scheme, had
made a very judicious disposition.</p>

<p>On the forenoon of the 13th of April, the
Prince began his attack on the right wing of
the French army, which occupied the village
of Bergen.—This was renewed with
great vivacity three several times. The
Prince of Isembourg, and about 1500 of
the Allies, fell in the action, which was
prolonged till the evening; Prince Ferdinand
then determining to draw off his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
troops, made such a disposition as persuaded
the enemy he intended a general attack next
morning—and by this means he accomplished
his retreat in the night, without
being harassed by the French.</p>

<p>I have heard officers of great merit assert,
that nothing could be more judiciously
planned and executed, than this enterprise;
the only one of importance, however, in
which that great General failed during the
whole war.</p>

<p>By this misfortune the allied army were
reduced to great difficulties, and the progress
of the French, with the continued retreat
of the Allies, spread such an alarm over the
Electorate of Hanover, that many individuals
sent their most valuable effects to Stade, from
whence they might be conveyed to England.—The
affairs of the Allies were soon
after re-established by the decisive victory of
Minden, which raised the military character<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
of Prince Ferdinand higher than ever;
though officers of penetration, who were
at both actions, are still of opinion, that
his talents were to the full as conspicuous
at Bergen, where he was repulsed, as at
the glorious field of Minden, by which
Hanover and Brunswick were preserved,
and the French obliged to abandon almost
all Westphalia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="LETTER_XLIX">LETTER XLIX.</h2>

<p class="right">Frankfort.</p>

<p>I returned a few days since from Darmstadt,
having accompanied the D—— of
H—— on a visit which he made to that
court.</p>

<p>The reigning Prince of Hesse Darmstadt
not being there, we were directed to pay our
first visit to the Princess Maximilian, his
aunt.—She invited us the same evening to
play at cards and sup with her.—There
were about ten people at table.—The Princess
was gay, affable, and talkative.—The
D—— confessed he never had passed an evening
so agreeably with an old woman in
his life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span></p>

<p>Next morning we went to the parade,
which is an object of great attention at this
place. The Prince has a most enthusiastic
passion for military manœuvres and evolutions.—Drilling
and exercising his soldiers
are his chief amusements, and almost his
sole employment. That he may enjoy this
in all kinds of weather, and at every season
of the year, he has built a room sufficiently
capacious to admit 1500 men, to perform
their exercise in it all together.</p>

<p>This room is accommodated with sixteen
stoves, by which it may be kept at the exact
degrees of temperature which suits his Highness’s
constitution.—On the morning that
we were present, there was only the ordinary
guard, consisting of three hundred men,
who having performed their exercises, and
marched for an hour up and down this spacious
Gymnasium, were divided into parties
and detached to their respective posts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span></p>

<p>The Darmstadt soldiers are tall, tolerably
clothed, and above all things remarkably
well powdered. They go through their
manœuvres with that dexterity which may
be expected of men who are continually
employed in the same action, under the
eye of their prince, who is an admirable
judge, and severe critic in this part of the
military art.</p>

<p>There is no regular fortification round
this town; but a very high stone-wall, which
is not intended to prevent an enemy from
entering, being by no means adequate to
such a purpose; but merely designed to hinder
the garrison from deserting, to which
they are exceedingly inclined; these poor
men taking no delight in the warlike amusements
which constitute the supreme joy of
their sovereign.</p>

<p>Centinels are placed at small distances all
round the wall, who are obliged to be exceedingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
alert. One soldier gives the words
<i>all is well</i> in German, to his neighbour on
the right, who immediately calls the same
to the centinel beyond him, and so it goes
round till the first soldier receives the
words from the left, which he transmits to
the right as formerly, and so the call circulates
without any intermission through
the whole night.</p>

<p>Every other part of garrison duty is performed
with equal exactness, and all neglects
as severely punished as if an enemy
were at the gates.</p>

<p>The men are seldom more than two
nights out of three in bed. This, with the
attention requisite to keep their clothes
and accoutrements clean, is very hard duty,
especially at present, when the frost is uncommonly
keen, and the ground covered
with snow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span></p>

<p>There is a small body of cavalry at
Darmstadt just now. They are dressed in
buff coats, and magnificently accoutred.—These
are the horse-guards of the prince.—Few
as they are, I never saw so many men
together of such a height in my life, none
of them being under six English feet three
inches high, and several of them considerably
above that enormous stature.</p>

<p>The Prince of Hesse Darmstadt formerly
kept a greater number of troops:
At present his whole army does not exceed
five thousand men. But as the conduct
of princes, however judicious it may
be, seldom passes uncensured, there are
people who blame him for entertaining
even this number. They declare, that
this prince’s finances, being in very great
disorder, cannot support this establishment;
which, though small, may be
counted high, considering the extent of
his dominions. They insist also upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
loss, which agriculture and manufactures
must sustain, by having the stoutest men
taken away from these necessary employments,
and their strength exhausted in useless
parade. For these rigid censors have
the assurance to assert, that an army of
five thousand men, though burdensome to
the country, is not sufficient to defend it;
that the number is by far too great for
amusement, and infinitely too small for any
manner of use.</p>

<p>The same day, we dined with the Princess
Maximilian, and in the afternoon
were presented to Prince George’s family.
He is brother to the reigning Prince.
He happened to be indisposed; but his
princess received the D—— with the utmost
politeness.</p>

<p>Their two youngest sons and three
daughters were at supper. The former
are still very young; the latter are well-looking,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
remarkably accomplished, and do
much credit to the great pains their mother
has bestowed on their education.</p>

<p>Next morning we were invited to breakfast,
by the Baron Riedesal, at a pleasant
country-house he has near Darmstadt.—His
G—— went with him, in a carriage of
a very particular construction. The Baron
sat on a low seat next the horses, and drove;
the D—— in a higher place behind him.
Each of these is made for one person only;
but behind all, there was a wooden seat, in
the shape of a little horse, on which two
servants were mounted. The usual posting-chaises
in this country hold six persons with
ease; and people even of the first rank
generally have two or three servants in the
chaise with them. In point of œconomy,
these carriages are well imagined; and, in
the time of frost, not inconvenient; for
here travellers take special care to fortify
themselves against cold by cloaks lined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>
with fur. But when it rains hard, two of
the company at least must be drenched; for
the German chaises are never intirely covered
above.</p>

<p>I went with Count Cullemberg in his
coach. We passed the forenoon very agreeably
at this house, which seems to be advantageously
situated; but in its present
snowy dress, one can no more judge of the
natural complexion of the country, than of
that of an actress new-painted for the stage.</p>

<p>We dined with Prince George, who was
sufficiently recovered to be at table. He is
a handsome man, of a soldier-like appearance,
and has all the ease and openness of
the military character.</p>

<p>His second son, who had been absent for
some weeks, arrived while we were at table.
He is a fine young man, about eighteen
years of age. It was pleasing to observe the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>
satisfaction which this small incident diffused
over the faces of father, mother, and
the whole family, which formed a groupe
worthy the pencil of Greuse.</p>

<p>Do not suspect that I am prejudiced in
favour of this family, merely because they
belong to a prince.—An appearance of
domestic happiness is always agreeable,
whether we find it in a palace or a cottage;
and the same symptoms of good humour,
though they would not have surprised
me so much, would have delighted
me equally in the family of a peasant.</p>

so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project

<h3>Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
